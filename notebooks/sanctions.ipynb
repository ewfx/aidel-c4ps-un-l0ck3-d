            "    - Reason for Sanction: Assa Corporation, which has a high similarity with Acme Corporation, is listed as a front company for Bank Melli, used to channel money from the United States to Iran.  This implies potential involvement in sanctions evasion and money laundering activities.\n",
            "    - Additional Insights: The address listed for Assa Corporation is in New York, USA.  The listed Tax ID should be further investigated to confirm a link between Acme Corporation and Assa Corporation.\n",

The presence of multiple dataset matches strengthens the likelihood of a sanction hit.  Furthermore, the \"target\": true flag in OpenSanctions indicates this is a direct match to a sanctioned entity.\n",
            "    - Additional Insights:  Cochan Holdings LLC is registered in the Marshall Islands, a known tax haven, which may raise further concerns.  The provided source URLs to OFAC and PermID offer avenues for further investigation and verification.  The \"referents\" field provides additional identifiers that can be used for enhanced due diligence.\n",

            "- Confidence Level: 0.90\n",
            "- Justification:  This transaction presents a significant risk due to the potential involvement of two entities with close matches to sanctioned entities. While the Acme Corporation match is based on a single source and requires further investigation, the Oceanic Holdings LLC match is a strong hit across multiple reputable datasets and is flagged as a direct target. The fact that both entities appear in the same transaction raises serious concerns about the nature and purpose of this transaction.  The potential for sanctions evasion and money laundering is high.  The use of a front company (Assa/Acme) in conjunction with an entity registered in a tax haven (Cochan/Oceanic) further amplifies the risk. It is highly recommended that this transaction be flagged and thoroughly investigated before proceeding.  The relatively high confidence level reflects the strong evidence provided by the OpenSanctions data, particularly for Oceanic Holdings LLC.  Further investigation should focus on verifying the connections between Acme Corporation and Assa Corporation, as well as understanding the relationship between the two entities involved in this transaction.\n",
