        The Sanction Analysis Risk Score is calculated using the following formula:
        sanctions_risk =  
        (OFAC_risk * 0.3) +  
        (reason_for_sanctions_risk * 0.2) +  
        (additional_insights_risk * 0.1)
        where:
        - OFAC_risk is a risk score assigned to Austenship Management Private Ltd based on the OpenSanctions database and the Panama Papers data.
        - Reason_for_sanctions_risk is a risk score based on the reason for the sanctions (Money Laundering).
        - Additional_insights_risk is a risk score based on other relevant information, such as the company's past illicit activities.

        The Sanction Analysis Risk Score is calculated as follows:
        sanctions_risk =  
        (0.8 * 0.3) +  
        (0.75 * 0.2) +  
        (0.15 * 0.1) = 0.75
        The Sanction Analysis Risk Score is calculated with a high confidence level (0.95), indicating that the risk assessment is accurate and reliable.

        The Entity Type Risk Score is calculated using the following formula:

        entity_type_risk =  
        (Shell_Company_risk * 0.15) +  
        (PEP_risk * 0.15) +  
        (Corporation_risk * 0.7)

        (0.2 * 0.15) +  
        (0 * 0.15) +  
        (0.9 * 0.7) = 0.15

Austenship Management Private Ltd operates in Commercial Banks and NEC sectors, while Ashmore Worldwide Limited operates in American Depositary Receipts sector. However, there is no significant mismatch between the sectors, as they are all financial sectors.

        The Sector Mismatch Risk Score is calculated using the following formula:
        sector_mismatch_risk =  
        (Number_of_Sector_Mismatches * 0.1) +  
        (Severity_of_Mismatches * 0.1) +  
        (Relevance_of_Mismatches * 0.8)
        where:
        - Number_of_Sector_Mismatches is the number of sectors associated with the entities that are not related.
        - Severity_of_Mismatches is a risk score based on the severity of the mismatched sectors.
        - Relevance_of_Mismatches is a risk score based on the relevance of the mismatched sectors to the transaction.

        The Sector Mismatch Risk Score is calculated as follows:
        sector_mismatch_risk =  
        (0 * 0.1) +  
        (0 * 0.1) +  
        (1 * 0.8) = 0.1

        (Number_of_Countries * 0.1) +  
        (FATF_Risk_Score * 0.2) +  
        (AML_Risk_Score * 0.2) +  
        (Country_Risk_Score * 0.5)
        where:
        - Number_of_Countries is the number of countries connected to the entities involved in the transaction.
        - FATF_Risk_Score is a risk score based on the FATF warning level for the countries connected to the entities.
        - AML_Risk_Score is a risk score based on the AML index for the countries connected to the entities.
        - Country_Risk_Score is a risk score based on the country risk ratings for the countries connected to the entities.


        The Geopolitical Risk Score is calculated as follows:
        geopolitical_risk =  
        (2 * 0.1) +  
        (0 * 0.2) +  
        (0 * 0.2) +  
        (2 * 0.5) = 0.4

        The Transaction Amount Risk Score is calculated based on the unusual amount of the transaction. The transaction amount is not provided in the JSON data, so this factor cannot be assessed.

        The Transaction Amount Risk Score is calculated using the following formula:
        transaction_amount_risk =  
        (Amount_Above_Average * 0.1) +  
        (Amount_Above_Entity_Average * 0.1) +  
        (Amount_Above_Past_Transaction_Average * 0.1) +  
        (Amount_Above_Industry_Average * 0.7)
        where:
        - Amount_Above_Average is the ratio of the transaction amount to the average transaction amount in the same sector.
        - Amount_Above_Entity_Average is the ratio of the transaction amount to the average transaction amount for the entities involved in the transaction.
        - Amount_Above_Past_Transaction_Average is the ratio of the transaction amount to the average transaction amount for similar transactions in the past.
        - Amount_Above_Industry_Average is the ratio of the transaction amount to the average transaction amount for the entire industry.

        (0 * 0.1) +  
        (0 * 0.1) +  
        (0 * 0.7) = 0

        Overall Risk Score

        The Overall Risk Score is calculated by combining the Sanction Analysis Risk Score, Entity Type Risk Score, Sector Mismatch Risk Score, Geopolitical Risk Score, and Transaction Amount Risk Score using a weighted average formula.

        Overall_Risk_Score =  
        (Sanction_Analysis_Risk_Score * 0.3) +  
        (Entity_Type_Risk_Score * 0.2) +  
        (Sector_Mismatch_Risk_Score * 0.15) +  
        (Geopolitical_Risk_Score * 0.15) +  
        (Transaction_Amount_Risk_Score * 0.2)

        The Overall Risk Score is calculated as follows:

        Overall_Risk_Score =  
        (0.75 * 0.3) +  
        (0.15 * 0.2) +  
        (0.1 * 0.15) +  
        (0.4 * 0.15) +  
        (0 * 0.2) = 0.75

        Justification

        The Sanction Analysis Risk Score indicates that Austenship Management Private Ltd has a history of money laundering activities, which increases the risk of the transaction. The company has been sanctioned by the US Treasury and has been linked to various illicit activities. Therefore, the transaction should be flagged for further investigation and potential sanctions.

        The Entity Type Risk Score indicates that Ashmore Worldwide Limited is a Corporation and Laila Khan is a PEP. While Ashmore Worldwide Limited does not have any known sanctions or illicit activities, Laila Khan has no known sanctions or illicit activities. However, the transaction involves Austenship Management Private Ltd, which is a Shell Company and a PEP. Therefore, the transaction should be flagged for further investigation and potential sanctions.

        The Sector Mismatch Risk Score indicates that there is no significant mismatch between the sectors associated with the entities involved in the transaction. The sectors are all financial sectors, which are generally considered low-risk.

        The Geopolitical Risk Score indicates that there is no significant geopolitical risk associated with the countries connected to the entities involved in the transaction. The United States and India have relatively low geopolitical risk scores.

        The Transaction Amount Risk Score cannot be assessed as the transaction amount is not provided in the JSON data.

        Conclusion

        Based on the provided JSON data, the transaction involving Austenship Management Private Ltd, Ashmore Worldwide Limited, and Laila Khan has a Sanction Analysis Risk Score of 0.75, indicating a relatively high risk level due to Austenship Management Private Ltd's history of money laundering activities.
