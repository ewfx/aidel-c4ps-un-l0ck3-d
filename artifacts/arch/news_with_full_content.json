            "full_content": "Microsoft is trying to show its commitment to AI safety by amending a lawsuit filed last year to unmask the four developers it alleges evaded guardrails on its AI tools in order to generate celebrity deepfakes. The company filed the lawsuit back in December, and a court order allowing Microsoft to seize a website associated with the operation helped it identify the individuals.\nThe four developers are reportedly part of a global cybercrime network called Storm-2139: Arian Yadegarnia aka “Fiz” of Iran; Alan Krysiak aka “Drago” of the United Kingdom; Ricky Yuen aka “cg-dot” of Hong Kong and Phát Phùng Tấn aka “Asakuri” of Vietnam.\nMicrosoft says there are others it has identified as involved in the scheme, but does not want to name them yet so as not to interfere with an ongoing investigation. The group, according to Microsoft, compromised accounts with access to its generative AI tools and managed to “jailbreak” them in order to create whatever types of images they desired. The group then sold access to others, who used it to create deepfake nudes of celebrities, among other abuses.\nAfter filing the lawsuit and seizing the group’s website, Microsoft said the defendants went into panic mode. “The seizure of this website and subsequent unsealing of the legal filings in January generated an immediate reaction from actors, in some cases causing group members to turn on and point fingers at one another,” it said on its blog.\nCelebrities, including Taylor Swift, have been frequent targets of deepfake pornography, which takes a real person’s face and convincingly superimposes it on a nude body. Back in January 2024, Microsoft had to update its text-to-image models after fake images of Swift appeared across the web, but the models can be tricked to ignore guardrails.\nGenerative AI makes it incredibly easy to create the images with little technical ability—which has already led to an epidemic of high schools across the U.S. experiencing deepfake scandals. Recent stories from victims of deepfakes illustrate how creating the images is not a victimless act because it occurs digitally but translates into real-world harm by making targets feel anxious, afraid, and violated knowing someone out there is obsessed with them enough to do it.\nThere has been an ongoing debate in the AI community regarding the topic of safety and whether the concerns are real or rather intended to help major players like OpenAI gain influence and sell their products by over-hyping the true power of generative artificial intelligence. One camp has argued that keeping AI models closed-source can help prevent the worst abuses by limiting users’ ability to turn off safety controls; those in the open-source camp believe making models free to modify and improve upon is necessary to accelerate the sector, and it is possible to address abuse without hindering innovation. Either way, it all feels like somewhat of a distraction from the more immediate threat, which is that AI has been filling the web with inaccurate information and slop content.\nBoth open and closed models often include license terms that set terms and prohibit certain uses, but enforcing those terms is another issue entirely.\nWhile a lot of fears about AI feel overblown and hypothetical in nature, and it seems unlikely that generative AI is anywhere near good enough to take on agency of its own, AI’s misuse to create deepfakes is real. Legal means are one way in which those abuses can be addressed regardless of whether a model is open or closed. There have already been a slew of arrests across the U.S. of individuals who have used AI to generate deepfakes of minors, and the NO FAKES Act introduced in Congress last year would make it a crime to generate images based on someone’s likeness. The United Kingdom already penalizes the distribution of deepfake porn, and soon it will also be a crime to even produce it. Australia recently criminalized the creation and sharing of non-consensual deepfakes.\n\nArtificial intelligencegenerative ailegalMicrosoft \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The Steam Deck's success boils down to ease of use, something that you may soon get on Asus or Lenovo-brand handhelds.\n        \n\n          Company contemplates packing device that tells time with cameras and 'visual intelligence.'\n        \n\n          More than simply inserting English voice recordings, actors' faces will be altered to make it appear that they are speaking natively.\n        \n\n          The company warns against applying strong supervision to chatbots, as they will continue lying and just not admit it.\n        \n\n          The biggest backer of OpenAI, Microsoft is now building its own AI models and teaming up with Sam Altman's mortal enemy.\n        \n\n          Is it an AI-generated newspaper, or an obituary?\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\n©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

The system combines voice-dictating and ambient listening tech created by AI voice company Nuance, which Microsoft bought in 2021.\nAccording to Microsoft’s announcement, the new system can help its users streamline their documentation through features like “multilanguage ambient note creation” and natural language dictation. Its AI assistant offers “general-purpose medical information searches from trusted content sources,” as well as the ability to automate tasks like “conversational orders, note and clinical evidence summaries, referral letters, and after visit summaries.”\nThe goal of all of this is to “free clinicians from much of the administrative burden of healthcare” so they can focus on patient care, according to Joe Petro, Microsoft VP of Microsoft Health and Life Sciences Solutions and Platforms. Microsoft says its own surveys found that clinicians who have used the Nuance tech that makes up Dragon Copilot suffered less burnout and that 93 percent of their patients reported a “better overall experience.”\nMicrosoft is one of many companies offering such AI tools for healthcare settings. A Google Cloud blog published today highlights how healthcare firms are using Google’s medical AI offerings, like by creating medical assistant AI agents for identifying patient health risks; they’re also using the new multimodal image-searching features Google debuted for its Vertex AI Search for healthcare product.\nThe FDA published considerations for generative AI devices in healthcare last year, in which it noted many potential benefits of the tech, but also the risks of models making things up. In a study last year, researchers found that was an issue at times with Nambla’s OpenAI Whisper-powered medical transcription software. Microsoft says it is “committed to developing responsible AI by design,” and that Dragon Copilot’s “capabilities are built on a secure data estate and incorporate healthcare-specific clinical, chat and compliance safeguards for accurate and safe AI outputs.”\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Right now, you have to pay for a monthly Microsoft 365 subscription to get access to the full desktop version of Office, but Microsoft has been quietly testing an ad-supported version in certain countries.\nBeebom first noticed that the ad-supported version of Office for Windows appeared in India recently, allowing Windows users to access Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other Office apps without the Microsoft 365 subscription fee.\n“Microsoft has been conducting some limited testing. Currently, there are no plans to launch a free, ad-supported version of Microsoft Office desktop apps,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to PCWorld. While Microsoft claims this is limited testing, the company has specifically engineered its Office apps to now work on Windows with ads, so we may well see this version appear in more markets eventually.\nThe ad-supported version of Office includes banners that are permanently visible at the side, as well as 15-second video ads that play every few hours, according to Beebom. Microsoft also forces users of this free version of Office to store documents in OneDrive, with support for local file storage disabled.\nMicrosoft currently only offers free versions of Office on the web, so you have to use a browser to access far more limited versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This test version of Office for Windows doesn’t include the full features of the apps, either. Word is missing drawing and design tools, line spacing, and more. The free version of Excel doesn’t support add-ins, pivot tables, or macros. PowerPoint is also missing support for dictation, custom slide shows, and other features.\nMicrosoft first started testing bundling AI-powered Office features into its Microsoft 365 subscriptions in a small number of countries before rolling out the changes worldwide with price increases.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Skype will be retired on May 5th, and existing users will need to export their data or migrate to Teams.\nSkype will be retired on May 5th, and existing users will need to export their data or migrate to Teams.\nIt’s the end of an era. Microsoft is shutting down Skype in May and replacing it with the free version of Microsoft Teams for consumers. Existing Skype users will be able to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats, and contacts all automatically available without having to create another account, or they can choose to export their data instead. Microsoft is also phasing out support for calling domestic or international numbers.\n”Skype users will be in control, they’ll have the choice,” says Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, in an interview with The Verge. “They can migrate their conversation history and their contacts out and move on if they want, or they can migrate to Teams.”\nIf you choose to move on and bring your Skype data with you, the exported data will include photos and conversation history. Microsoft also made a tool to easily view existing Skype chat history if you don’t want to move to Teams.\nSkype will remain online until May 5th, so existing users will have around 60 days to decide whether they want to switch to Microsoft Teams or export their data. “If they do want to come to Teams then the first-run is pretty instantaneous because we’ve already done the work on the backend to restore their contacts, message history, and call logs,” says Amit Fulay, vice president of product at Microsoft.\nThe transition to Microsoft Teams will keep Skype group chats intact, and during the 60-day window, Microsoft will also maintain interoperability so you can message contacts on Teams and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype.\nIf you do move to Microsoft Teams, there’s one big part of Skype that’s disappearing, though. Microsoft is removing the telephony parts that allow you to call domestic or international numbers or people’s cellphones. “Part of the reason is we look at the usage and the trends, and this functionality was great at the time when voice over IP (VoIP) wasn’t available and mobile data plans were very expensive,” explains Fulay. “If we look at the future, that’s not a thing we want to be in.”\nMicrosoft will honor existing Skype credits, but it will no longer offer new customers access to paid Skype features that allow you to make or receive international and domestic calls. Existing Skype subscription users will be able to use their Skype credits and subscriptions inside Microsoft Teams until the end of their next renewal period. Existing Skype Number users will also need to port their number over to another provider, as Microsoft is no longer supporting this, either.\nThe Skype Dial Pad will be part of Teams temporarily for existing credits and subscriptions, but Microsoft isn’t going to offer calling plans to Teams consumers like it does for businesses. “The world has really moved on,” says Teper. “Probably the biggest thing is higher bandwidth and lower data plan cost, from us and others, has really driven almost all of the traffic to VoIP.”\nThe admission of consumers moving on from calling phone numbers from Skype is also a large part of why the service is shutting down nearly 14 years after Microsoft first acquired it for $8.5 billion. Over the last decade, services like FaceTime, Messenger, and WhatsApp have made it simple to connect with friends through messaging, calls, and video chats in a way that Microsoft struggled to compete with through Skype and its many design iterations.\nThis was particularly evident in the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when consumers flocked to Zoom instead of Skype. “The Skype userbase actually grew at the beginning of the pandemic, and has been pretty flat since,” admits Teper. “It’s not shrunk in some dramatic way. It has been relatively flat over the last few years. We hope we’ll migrate most Skype users… but we want to make sure the users know they’re in control.”\nMicrosoft will now be fully focused on Teams for consumers, after launching the personal version in 2020. At the time, Microsoft said it was still fully committed to Skype, but it’s been clear in recent years that the company was preparing for the eventual retirement of Skype. In December, Microsoft killed off Skype credits and phone numbers in favor of subscriptions, another sign that the end of Skype was nearing.\n“Initially the vision was to have one experience across work and life… but Teams was new and that was not realistically where we were in 2020,” reveals Teper. “So we continued to invest in Skype, and about two to three years ago we started bringing in the free Teams consumer experience with the new client. We wanted to wait until the adoption was at the scale where we could be very convinced it was the right time.”\nThe Skype retirement won’t result in job cuts, either, at least not immediately. “There’s one team, which is Microsoft Teams and Skype. On the backend it has actually evolved to a common team,” says Teper. “There won’t be layoffs, those folks are going to be working on making things better — whether it’s fun end user features or AI innovation, it’s really about doubling down on Teams.”\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years’ worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\nOn the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s business-related blogs and guidance no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\nOne now deleted blog, titled “Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?” explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled “$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance” instructs tech companies on how to abide by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.\nAnother removed FTC blog titled “The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust” outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog won an award in 2023 for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”\nThe Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta, as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have started to roll out AI products like GSAi, a general-purpose government chatbot.\nThe FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\nRemoving blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.\nSince President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s long-standing allegations that social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, The New York Times reported in December.\nIn an interview with CNBC last week, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. “If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.\nSources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.\n“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies’ bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\nDOGE takeover: Elon Musk’s toxicity could spell disaster for Tesla\nBig Story: A crypto crimefighter’s descent into Nigerian prison\nI dated multiple AI partners at once.

Microsoft is unveiling six of its own AI agents for its Security Copilot, as well as five that have been created by its partners.\nMicrosoft’s six security agents will be available in preview next month, and are designed to do things like triage and process phishing and data loss alerts, prioritize critical incidents, and monitor for vulnerabilities. “The six Microsoft Security Copilot agents enable teams to autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks while seamlessly integrating with Microsoft Security solutions,“ says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.\nMicrosoft is also working with OneTrust, Aviatrix, BlueVoyant, Tanium, and Fletch to enable some third-party security agents. These extensions will make it easier to analyze data breaches with OneTrust or perform root cause analysis of network outages and failures with Aviatrix.\nAI agents are becoming an increasingly popular way for companies like Microsoft to sell businesses on AI tools. Microsoft relaunched its Copilot for businesses earlier this year with free AI chat and access to pay-as-you-go AI agents.\nWhile these latest AI agents in the Security Copilot are designed for security teams to take advantage of, Microsoft is also improving its phishing protection in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will start protecting Teams users against phishing and other cyberthreats within Teams next month, including better protection against malicious URLs and attachments.\nMicrosoft also has a lot of other industry-specific security announcements today and at its upcoming Microsoft Secure event on April 9th. You can read more about them over at Microsoft’s security blog.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

In this new age of American Monarchy, Trump is indeed their sugar daddy.  The rich companies complain to him, pay their bribe, and he fixes it.  This is how trump has always worked.  At the same time it's very true he doesn't care about them. But he does care about himself and how he looks.  Each party manipulates the other to get what they want. That's how a transactional relationship works.

However, the ESA says the timeline for the implementation of the tags will be “determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary.”\n“The timeline for implementation of the tags is company-dependent,” Aubrey Quinn, ESA’s senior vice president for communications, tells The Verge. “While we cannot speak for them about their plans, we know companies are working with the relevant departments across their individual organizations to bring the tags to their consumers.”\nThe five founding members and Sony Interactive Entertainment “first developed” the initiative. When we asked why Sony isn’t a founding member, Quinn told us to reach out to Sony, which didn’t reply to a request for comment. Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Bros. Games have joined the initiative, too.\nThe Verge has asked all of the companies involved when they might implement the tags.

The Patch Tuesday updates that started rolling out on March 11th have led to Copilot being unpinned from the taskbar and uninstalled.\n“We’re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some devices,” admits Microsoft in a support document for the March update to Windows 11.

Microsoft is in the middle of rolling out a native version of its Copilot for Windows app, nearly a year after turning it into a basic web app. The new Copilot app has an improved UI and is also getting a press-to-talk hotkey so you can talk to Microsoft’s AI assistant like you used to be able to do with Cortana in Windows 10.\nMicrosoft is also working on additional updates to Copilot that it’s planning to unveil at a special 50th anniversary event on April 4th.

            "full_content": "Skype was once a pioneering VoIP service, but Microsoft effectively killed it 10 years ago.\nSkype was once a pioneering VoIP service, but Microsoft effectively killed it 10 years ago.\nSkype was Microsoft’s biggest-ever acquisition in 2011, a deal brokered by former CEO Steve Ballmer when the company was trying to compete with the rise of the iPhone. But after spending $8.5 billion on Skype, Microsoft dropped the ball again and again over the past 14 years, to the point where Skype was so irrelevant during a global pandemic that everyone used Zoom instead.\nSkype has been relegated to a forgotten relic of an era before Google and Apple’s mobile dominance, and Microsoft is now laying it to rest alongside other failed mobile efforts like Windows Phone. It wasn’t always this way, though.\nIn early 2012, a few months after Microsoft’s acquisition, I visited the Skype offices in Stockholm that engineers had just moved into. Skype had just passed 41 million concurrent users, more than even Steam’s recent record. Skype was so popular at the time that people kept stealing the Skype signs outside its offices, so the company simply stopped replacing them.\nInside the Skype Stockholm office, I met engineers who were excited and nervous about Microsoft’s acquisition, but who had been reassured by a visit from Ballmer, who shook their hands and promised that Microsoft was investing in the team to double its size from 100 employees to 200 by the end of 2012. While that investment happened, Microsoft closed the Stockholm office five years later as it reorganized engineering teams.\nThe one thing that struck me from that visit was that Skype’s office felt nothing like a typical Microsoft office: there was no formal dress code, the walls were covered in special acoustics panels, and meetings were held over Skype’s network. Some Skype employees told me at the time that they were struggling to get used to the heavy use of email by Microsoft’s various teams. It was an early sign that integrating Skype into Microsoft’s way of working was going to be more challenging than just updating software.\nIn the early days of the Skype division at Microsoft, the team was focused on building a new version of Skype for a touch-friendly version of Windows. Rick Osterloh, former head of Skype products and design, told me during my 2012 visit that “Windows 8 is a big focus for us.” Osterloh, who now oversees Google’s devices and services efforts, left Skype just months after my visit and rejoined Motorola Mobility. Skype shipped a Windows 8 app the same year Osterloh left, with huge backend changes that were supposed to prepare it for a mobile future.\nAs Skype increasingly turned its focus to mobile, the problems with overhauling its aging peer-to-peer infrastructure started to emerge. Microsoft began migrating Skype users to its Messenger platform in 2012, which previously helped power MSN Messenger, to improve the ability to send chat messages and pick up calls on multiple devices. This transition lasted years and resulted in many bugs, including calls, messages, and notifications repeating on multiple devices. There were countless app redesigns, and basic problems with calling and messaging were becoming apparent. I wrote in 2016 that “Microsoft needs to fix Skype” after a painful couple of years of issues with the service.\nMicrosoft was too busy adding emoji and trying to compete with the rise of WhatsApp, FaceTime, Snapchat, and Facebook Messenger that it had fallen short on the very basics of Skype. It had gotten to the point, in 2016, where people were using Skype begrudgingly, simply because it was ubiquitous and nothing had replaced it yet.\nInstead of addressing the many fundamental issues with Skype calling and messaging, Microsoft went ahead and introduced a radical redesign of Skype in 2017 that didn’t go down well. The layout looked nothing like Skype and resembled something more like Snapchat. Microsoft was forced to redesign Skype once again in 2018 and walk back the Snapchat-like changes, but it was too late. WhatsApp, Messenger, FaceTime, WeChat, Line, and Telegram had already become entrenched by then, offering easy video calls and reliable messaging.\nI wrote in 2018 that it would be “difficult for Microsoft to now win back consumer trust when there are now so many reliable alternatives,” and that’s exactly what happened. Microsoft’s Skype struggles created a Zoom moment in early 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic forced everyone to use video and voice calls to connect with friends and family. Instead of heading to Skype, consumers picked Zoom for its ease of use and reliability.\nIn response, Microsoft quickly pivoted its consumer focus to Teams, launching a personal version in the middle of 2020. That’s what is slated to replace Skype in May. Teams doesn’t try to compete with WhatsApp, Messenger, or other chat apps; instead, it’s there for people who want to do more than just chat and is designed around groups of friends or family activities.\nThere’s no longer a Skype division inside Microsoft, and there hasn’t been for some time. What’s left of the Skype team has been combined with the Teams org and will work on future features of the app. \nMicrosoft might have stumbled with Skype, but this acquisition helped bring Teams to life in 2016, and it even acted as a bridge to transition business users from its Lync enterprise messaging software to Skype for Business and, eventually, Teams. \n“It’s very much true that a lot of the learning from Skype and some of the code evolved into Teams,” said Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, in an interview with The Verge recently. “The calling and message infrastructure did evolve, on the backend, out of the Skype codebase. At this point the amount of code that’s different is extremely high, but there was definitely an evolutionary path of us learning how to do A/V calling.”\nNow, we wait to see how Microsoft Teams will fare on the consumer side. While Teams has 320 million monthly users overall, the vast majority of those are business users. Teams is still a little clunky for personal use, despite the company moving to a single app for personal and work. None of my friends or family members actually use Teams outside of the office, but I get a sense that Microsoft might be fine with serving this smaller market. After all, Microsoft’s early experiences with Skype helped it build a communications platform that now makes its paid Microsoft 365 subscriptions even stickier.\nMSN Messenger and Skype walked so Microsoft Teams could run, but given the amount of complaints I hear about Teams these days, I don’t know that Microsoft has moved past the issues it faced with Skype 10 years ago. I often run into issues joining Teams calls because of the complexities of switching tenants, or just because I’m using a personal Microsoft account and Teams gets confused. I also have two Teams icons in my system tray for some reason.\nCompared to Slack, the messaging part of Teams is still very basic, although Microsoft is looking to address that with threads and combined chats and channels soon. There are plenty of areas for improvement with Teams, and while the faster and redesigned client is a good step in the right direction, it should be the foundation for bigger changes. The Teams complaints are growing — Microsoft will need to address them a lot faster this time if it wants to avoid another Skype situation.\nWhat do you think about Microsoft killing off Skype?

The Microsoft Surface Pro laptop is a super versatile option that can fulfill a lot of the needs of pretty much anyone, be it youâre a student, small business owner, or just someone who wants to go online with something other than their phone.\nRight now, you can get the 2024 Microsoft Surface Pro laptop for a crazy $350 off: Thatâs a 25% discount that brings the price down from $1,399 to just $1,049.\nThis Microsoft Surface Pro laptop boasts a Snapdragon X Elite 12-core processor, engineered for exceptional speed and performance. It surpasses the MacBook Airâs M3 chip in efficiency and ensures effortless productivity with AI applications, which I guess is a thing now. It comes with either 16GB of 32GB of memory (the one at $1,050 comes with 16GB of RAM), allowing for smooth performance across a diverse range of applications, whether your using them for school work, business or leisure. The storage options available include 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB so youâll have plenty of space for files, photos, and more.\nJust like most new tech products of the last year or so, Microsoft totes this Surface as being built for the new era of AI. The laptop supports Copilot+, Microsoftâs foray into the AI space which offers generative art from text image prompts and an the ability to easily retrieve documents or web pages which honestly just sounds like what your search bar already does.\nCalls are supposedly enhanced with Copilot+, improving lighting, canceling noise, and blurring out distractions. Though all that was already supported, weâre all just giving it the AI label now for marketing reasons.\nThe OLED display is nice and large at 13 inches across. It has a touchscreen so you can go back and forth between interfacing it like a tablet or using the mouse and keyboard like traditional laptopâgreat to have that versatility.\nThereâs hardly any bezel at all so you really maximize your screen real estate while keeping the laptop compact. And the laptop itself is thin and lightweight, keeping it easy to bring back and forth from the classroom to the dorm room or from your home to a nearby coffee shop. Portability at its finest. The battery is reliable and long-lasting, able to keep your laptop running for up to 14 hours.\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox platform is shaping up.﻿\nMicrosoft’s next-gen Xbox platform is shaping up.﻿\nMicrosoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer warned in November that the mythical Xbox handheld is a few years away and only at the prototype stage right now. But if you read the headlines this week, you might think it’s actually arriving later this year.\nA new report from Windows Central claims that “Xbox’s new hardware plans begin with a gaming handheld set for later this year, with full next-gen consoles targeting 2027” and that Microsoft is working on a “Project Keenan” handheld in partnership with an unnamed OEM. The report has generated plenty of headlines about an Xbox handheld arriving in 2025, but the reality is a little more complicated and related to Microsoft’s Xbox platform work to compete with SteamOS.\nSources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me the company’s Xbox platform plans for this year and beyond are centered on one big goal: the unification of Windows and Xbox. Jason Ronald, VP of Xbox gaming devices and ecosystem, revealed to The Verge in January that the company is combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together” and that we’d start to see changes later in 2025.\nI understand the Xbox work that has hit the headlines this week is actually called Project Kennan, not Keenan. I’m told that Kennan is the codename for a handheld that is being manufactured by Asus, and it’s part of a larger effort from Microsoft to unify Windows and Xbox towards a universal library of Xbox and PC games.\nI’m told that Asus is one of the launch partners for these efforts, with an Xbox-branded handheld likely to debut later this year. I say likely because a lot of this platform work is still ongoing, so until Microsoft officially announces it, timelines could change.\nThe device itself will be powered by Windows underneath but with an interface that more closely resembles what you’d find on an Xbox. I wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft has some kind of certified hardware program here, so that only approved third-party devices can run “the best of Xbox and Windows.”\nSome of this platform work is codenamed Project Bayside, part of an Xbox UX framework that is designed to ensure there’s a common Xbox UI across multiple devices to help combine Windows and Xbox. Together, Kennan and Bayside represent some of the work that Ronald was hinting at, opening up the benefits of Xbox to the broader Windows ecosystem.\nMicrosoft is also working on combining Windows and Xbox in a way where there’s a single store of games and an easier path for game developers to build titles that span across handhelds, console-like hardware, and PC gaming rigs.\nThe big question is whether all of these platform changes will unlock the ability to play Xbox games on these new handheld gaming PCs. Microsoft has a lot of experience running emulators to get original Xbox and Xbox 360 games working on the Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X, so if anyone can bring Xbox games to PC, it’s Microsoft. \nCommunity efforts to get Xbox One games running on PC are making solid progress, with XWineOne and WinDurango both working on layers to translate Xbox API calls to Windows ones. It’s similar to some of the work Valve has done with Proton to get Windows games running on Linux. \nMost of the community progress with Xbox One games running on PC has been thanks to a kernel exploit for Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles that was uncovered last year. This exploit, which was actually a flaw in Windows, was patched quickly by Microsoft, but it was too late to stop enthusiasts dumping Xbox One games to get a better understanding of how they’re different from their PC versions.\nWhile we wait to see if the community can come up with a full solution to run Xbox games on Windows, it looks like Microsoft is working on something similar. Xbox president Sarah Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, which suggests that Microsoft is working through the licensing hurdles to somehow preserve existing Xbox digital libraries for this universal library of Xbox and PC games.\nIt’s reasonable to assume that these Xbox platform changes will shape the future of Xbox consoles, too. I wrote last month that “I don’t think Microsoft is embarking on such a big project without these handheld-focused platform changes being the foundation for whatever Xbox hardware comes next.”\nWindows Central reports that Microsoft is working on a “premium successor” to the Xbox Series X alongside its own Xbox handheld that is tentatively slated for release in 2027. I’m fully expecting Microsoft’s next Xbox console to be a lot more PC-like, so the Kennan and Bayside projects will likely give us an early look at how the next-gen Xbox will take shape on the software side, at least.\nThese Xbox platform changes could also help fend off the threat of SteamOS. I wrote last year that Microsoft is now in a handheld gaming PC race, with Valve allowing device makers to offer SteamOS on their handhelds instead of Windows. Microsoft has been slow to respond to the Steam Deck, particularly around improving the Windows experience on handhelds like Asus’ ROG Ally. Valve opening up SteamOS last summer and then Lenovo introducing its own SteamOS-powered handheld in January will have sounded the alarms inside Microsoft, because if one Windows OEM has already been tempted by SteamOS then what’s stopping more of them from switching?\nThis is particularly relevant beyond the emerging market of handhelds, too. Valve is now in a far better position to make its console-like Steam Machines a reality, thanks to the success of the Steam Deck and its Proton work. If OEMs get comfortable with SteamOS on their handhelds, the next logical step is a demand for SteamOS on something more like a miniature PC or game console. \nMicrosoft is already struggling to compete with Sony’s PlayStation hardware sales, but if its next-gen Xbox platform is able to run on more PC-like hardware, it could compete a lot more closely. It would also make those “this is an Xbox” ads make a lot more sense.\nThere are a lot of ifs, buts, and maybes here. Ultimately, it’s the execution from Microsoft that will be important. I’ve already laid out how I think Microsoft can turn Windows PCs into an Xbox, and all that is left is to hear from Microsoft on exactly how it will merge the best bits of Windows and Xbox.\nAre you interested in a combined Windows and Xbox handheld?

            "full_content": "If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nPour out a little liquor. Microsoft has announced that Skype, the popular video-calling app of the early 2010s, will finally be laid to rest on May 5.\nMicrosoft acquired the app in 2011 for a staggering $8.5 billion—some 40 percent higher than its internal valuation and the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time. Some quick math by WIRED editor Jeremy White worked out that's a cost to the company of around $1.6 million per day since its acquisition, and it's hard to believe such a heavy investment has really paid off.\nThere were good days though. In 2016, at its peak, it was estimated there were around 300 million users—but then the competition arrived thick and fast. As we turned to new tools like Slack, Zoom, Whatsapp calling, and Microsoft's own Teams, Skype struggled to keep hold of its user base. As of 2023, the most recent data Microsoft shared put it at 36 million users worldwide.\nDon't panic if you're one of them, the service won't be switched off immediately. You have 10 weeks to migrate your chats and contacts over to a free version of Teams for consumers, or you can also use the app's export tool to download your data.\nFor those who decide to make the move, all your Skype group chats will port over, and if you make the move before your friends do, messages sent from Teams will be delivered to Skype during the migration period. Microsoft is removing the ability to make domestic or international phone calls after May 5, though—something that was once Skype's bread-and-butter functionality but now something better solved by other tools.\nWait, isn't there a Photoshop app already, we hear you cry? Yes. Well, sort of. For anyone loyal to the brand, Adobe has offered Photoshop Express Photo Editor for basic photo editing on the go for years, but it has lacked many of the more powerful features that make Photoshop, well, Photoshop. This week, Adobe finally announced a full-fat, official Photoshop app for the iPhone, (with an Android version promised as “coming soon”), and it's much closer to what you'd expect.\nIt's still a totally different experience to the desktop version, having been redesigned to fit a smaller screen, but if anything it's more intuitive and easier to use than on the desktop. There's nothing stripped down about the mobile version in this go-round, and it includes all the features you're accustomed to—from layer-based editing to AI-powered tools like Generative Fill and Generative Expand.\nThe app is free, though some features require the $8 per month (or $70 yearly) subscription. If you subscribe, you'll get access to the full suite of Photoshop's Adobe Firefly AI tools, like Generate Similar and Reference Image, along with Object Select, Magic Wand, the Clone Stamp, plus the more than 20,000 fonts available via Adobe.\nHaving played with the app for a few days now, I am happy to report that this is the full power of Photoshop on your iPhone. Layer-based editing works quite well, even with the limited screen real estate of a smartphone (it will be interesting to see how this plays out on Android where there is much greater range of screens available). The interface consists of selecting a primary tool and then a contextual menu at the bottom of the screen with the options for that tool. As with Photoshop on the desktop, the mobile app has a learning curve to figure out how you get to all the tools you're used to, but once you get that down, editing images is surprisingly simple.\nThe iPhone app syncs with your Adobe account—if you have one—which means you can pull photos from Lightroom or digital paintings from Fresco. You can also grab images from the Adobe Stock photo free collection and all the licensing is handled for you. —Scott Gilbertson\nWhen Google launched the Pixel Watch 3 last summer, the headline feature was one we haven't seen before on a smartwatch: loss of pulse detection. But the FDA hadn't cleared it yet, so it was available in only a few European countries. That changed this week, and now Google says Loss of Pulse will arrive to the Pixel Watch 3 in the US by the end of March.\nMore than 300,000 people die every year in the US from cardiac arrest, and immediate treatment is vital in saving someone's life. The Pixel Watch 3's feature uses complex algorithms to determine whether someone is purposefully moving when it detects no pulse—taking your watch off won't make it think you're having a heart attack. There are redundancies just in case, so a prompt appears on the screen and you can clear it if you're OK. If you're unresponsive, the watch will contact emergency services and will play audio through the speaker for potential bystanders to intervene.\nAll the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:\nConsumer fitness wearables like the Oura Ring represent a tremendous opportunity to collect large amounts of data on underserved populations, as we’ve reported before. This week, Oura announced a research collaboration with Scripps Research Digital Trials Center to look at physiological changes in pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications to help pinpoint warning signs of miscarriage, postpartum depression, or preterm labor. The study will recruit 10,000 subjects through the Oura app, who will provide data through the Oura Ring, upload health records, and complete surveys if they choose.\nThis study joins others that use Oura Rings, like an ongoing study at Stanford to look at menstrual cycles across diverse populations. Oura’s efforts aren’t precisely unique—Apple kickstarted a long-term Women’s Health Study that has also looked at vital signs during pregnancy. However, what Oura and Scripps are doing is large-scale (Apple’s pregnancy health study had 733 participants) and has the potential to help bridge significant gaps in maternal health. This is crucial, especially at a time when the current administration has shelved other women’s health initiatives. Caring for a healthy baby starts with caring for a healthy mom. —Adrienne So\nPanasonic's new Lumix S1R II is one of the most interesting full-frame mirrorless cameras to come along in some time. With video and photo capabilities that stack up well against competitors like the Nikon Z8 and Canon R5 Mark II, the S1R II is a great all-around camera for those looking to shoot both high-resolution still and video.\nThe body is significantly smaller and lighter than the original S1R, and it has a slightly lower-resolution but much faster 44-megapixel CMOS sensor. The sensor isn't stacked, which makes it a little less capable for those shooting sports and fast-moving action scenes, but the video features more than make up for that for most users. The S1R II can record up to 8K video at 30p, with support for in-camera recording of ProRes 422 and ProRes RAW capture. There's also support for 32-bit float audio using an optional XLR 2 adapter.\nOn the photo side there's faster autofocus and some improved subject tracking algorithms for people, animals (dogs, cats, birds), cars, bikes (and motorcycles), trains and airplanes. You'll also get up to 40fps continuous shooting with pre-burst capture and 10 fps if you stick to the mechanical shutter. Perhaps most intriguing is the new high-res photo mode which captures a 177-megapixel image and can be used without a tripod according to Panasonic. The S1R II will be available in late March for $3,300. —Scott Gilbertson\nClicks Keyboard Case on Razr (left) and Pixel 9 in Surge colorway (right)\nYou’ve likely seen the Clicks Keyboard Case on your social feeds (it’s gone viral a handful of times on TikTok). It’s the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in physical keyboard, which not only gives you tactile feedback while typing but also increases screen real estate because there’s no longer a virtual keyboard in the way of the display. This week, the company finally revealed cases for select Android phones. Specifically, the Google Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, Motorola Razr+ (2024), and Samsung Galaxy S25.\nLike the latest iPhone 16 version, the Clicks for Android case comes equipped with contoured, tactile keys that are backlit, brushed metal side keys, and a microfiber interior. You can also configure all the buttons to trigger shortcuts, including the Gemini key, Clicks key, and emoji key within the companion Clicks app. You can also use the app to customize additional settings like the brightness of the backlight or enable features like Caps Lock, Soft Return, and more.\nWhile each case supports passthrough USB-C charging, only the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro cases support wireless charging thanks to an array of built-in magnets. It's a little odd that the Galaxy S25 case doesn't feature this as well, especially since Samsung's new phone is Qi2 Ready.\nThe Clicks Keyboard Cases are available in various colors depending on the model. The Pixel case comes in Surge and Onyx, the Razr+ case is available in Electric and Onyx, and the Galaxy S25 case has Pinot and Onyx. You can preorder the Google Pixel 9/9 Pro case now for $99 until March 21, but after that, the price increases to $139. It ships in April. Meanwhile, cases for the Razr+ and Galaxy S25 can be reserved for $49 to secure the launch price of $99 until March 21 (Clicks says preorders will remain available for $49, but the final price will increase to $139). Those cases will ship in late May and June, respectively. —Brenda Stolyar\nIn the same world of accessories, Plugable is shipping its 10-port USB-C hub. No, it's not a generic hub with various ports—it's literally 10 USB-C Power Delivery (PD) ports lined up next to each other in one elongated slab of 50 percent postconsumer recycled aluminum. The PS-10CC was announced last year as part of a Kickstarter campaign, but it's available as of this week for $100.\nPlugable says it features Intelligent Power Allocation, so it'll dish out the right amount of power to whatever devices are connected to the hub, and select kinds of devices are prioritized to charge first, like laptops and smartphones. Next to each USB-C port is an LED that indicates if it's successfully charging, operating at max output (100 watts), or if the connected device is incompatible. The downside is there's no data-transfer support here, and no power supply is included. Plugable says you can use any charger from 18 to 100 watts to use the hub, though presumably you'll need a higher wattage if you have 10 high-power gadgets plugged in.\nHTC may not be a household name anymore, but it's still chugging along with its virtual reality ambitions. This week, the company announced Viverse Worlds, a platform that likens itself to the YouTube of 3D content. HTC launched Viverse a couple of years ago, and you can think of it as the underlying platform that lets people create and socialize in virtual worlds. Viverse Worlds is the hub—a curated experience by HTC that shows off the most interesting worlds of the day.\nThe experience isn't too different from going to YouTube.com and seeing the latest videos the algorithm suggests. Except here, these worlds are interactive. You can view the virtual spaces people have created, and even socialize with others through a digital avatar—no account needed. Viverse Worlds is accessible via the web so you can hop into worlds on any device, even smartphones, though the best experience will be through a virtual reality headset. There's a unified control scheme that also helps with this.\nHTC says it's easy for anyone to create and publish to Viverse Worlds, and the company also is hoping businesses will use the platform to show off 3D products and embed them into Shopify. Eventually, HTC expects Viverse Worlds will be supported by advertising, and if the platform grows, creators will be able to enable in-app purchases and subscriber-only content.\nWhat do you get when you combine two icons? Pat McGrath, one of the most well-known and influential makeup artists, is collaborating with Candy Crush Saga on a new beauty collection full of limited-edition MatteTrance lipsticks, Lust:Gloss lip glosses, and nail polishes. And I’m here for it. Beauty brands collaborating with cultural staples is nothing new—the Colourpop Cosmetics Twilight Collection and One/Size Wicked Collection are two that come to mind—but the mobile game nerd in me is stoked that Candy Crush Saga is in the spotlight.\nThe packaging is vivid and the makeup is color-soaked goodness that looks like it popped out of your phone screen. Prices start at $29 or you can snag the whole collection for $174. There’s also a strange Willy Wonka-esque element—there are three bespoke, bejeweled rings that were “originally intended” for Pat McGrath’s friends but will be delivered to three random lucky winners (you can enter by purchasing a MatteTrance lipstick or by mail). The collection is available at Pat McGrath Labs now and will launch at Sephora and Nordstrom later this month. —Louryn Strampe\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\nDOGE takeover: Elon Musk’s toxicity could spell disaster for Tesla\nBig Story: A crypto crimefighter’s descent into Nigerian prison\nI dated multiple AI partners at once.

            "full_content": "Skype is going to go the way of Dodo in a few months. Microsoft has now said you should jump on Teams instead. The Microsoft-owned video conferencing tool missed the boat on the pandemic-era boom, but itâs still sad to see it go, especially because Microsoft wants to keep pushing Teams in front of all Windows 11 users as a kind of default messaging app.\nXDA Developers first confirmed that code found within the latest Skype for Windows preview build includes a line reading, âStarting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams.â That explicitly spells out the plans for Skypeâs deprecation in favor of Microsoftâs main-line voice and video chat software. In an email statement, the company told Gizmodo that Microsoft is ending the service on May 5.\nA Microsoft spokesperson wrote, “[Teams] offers the same core features as Skype, such as 1:1 and group calls, messaging, and file sharing, and comes with enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities.”\nMicrosoft 365 president Jeff Teper told Techcrunch, “Putting all our focus behind Teams will let us give a simpler message and drive faster innovation.â Teper added that they had considered shutting down Skype âfor a while,â but Microsoft was looking for when user numbers were low enough to justify taking the app off life support.\nUsers have until the big day to move all their contacts and chats to Teams, or they will need to export their data. Microsoft said users should be able to switch by logging into Teams with a Skype username and password, which should bring along all their contacts. The company provided a video explaining how the transition will work.\nSkype is legacy software dating back to 2003, though itâs been in Microsoftâs hands since 2011 after a $8.5 billion buyout. After that, it has had its own division within the larger company. The app includes voice, video, and text messaging, though I personally used it to call mobile phones over the internet while abroad, especially back when getting a separate SIM card working was such a headache. In Microsoftâs hands, Skype was the reason Windows Live Messenger also suffered a sudden case of vaporware syndrome. Oh, how the tables have turned.\nThe company updated Skype to use a P2P protocol in 2017 within Microsoft Azureâs cloud services. There was even a time when the tech giant baked Skype directly into Windows 10. Now, itâs been replaced by Teams as Microsoftâs default video messaging app. Then, less than a year later, in 2016, Microsoft claimed Skype wasnât meeting usersâ needs and replaced it with a WUP app. In 2021, Microsoft set Teams as its default integrated communications app for Windows 11. The company continued supporting Skype with UI updates, even going so far as to add AI to it in 2023.\nThe thing is, people still use Skype. Microsoft last released user numbers for its aging call software in 2023; it claimed there were still 36 million daily active users. That number may have slipped since then, but a fair number likely wonât be happy about being forced onto Teams. Thatâs especially true becauseÂ Teams still feels very business-oriented, even if searching for specific conversations or links can be occasionally awkward.\nTeams came on the scene in 2016 as an alternative to Slack. It used to be a part of the default Office (now Windows 365) suite, though Microsoft separated Teams from Office last year to appease European regulators. Either way, Teams is supposed to be Microsoftâs mainline communication tool as it desperately tries to force Windows users to facilitate Microsoft-owned apps. Last year, Teams added the ability to chat in VR with 3D avatars through its Mesh service. Now that Microsoft is all about AI, Skype can be remembered as an app from a simpler time when apps did what they said on the tin.\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The Steam Deck's success boils down to ease of use, something that you may soon get on Asus or Lenovo-brand handhelds.\n        \n\n          The biggest backer of OpenAI, Microsoft is now building its own AI models and teaming up with Sam Altman's mortal enemy.\n        \n\n          All you need is an Xbox 360, a USB drive and two specific games to access homebrews or previously region-locked titles.\n        \n\n          Those rumors about Microsoft making it own Xbox handheld may have been hasty, but we could see the Xbox version of SteamOS instead.\n        \n\n          The major investor in OpenAI has been looking to cut ties as the two companies start looking more like competitors.\n        \n\n          Microsoft amended a lawsuit filed last year to name the four defendants whom it alleges misused its AI models to create celebrity deepfakes.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk somehow manages to win again. Microsoft, along with BlackRock and UAE-based MGX, have announced they are partnering with his artificial intelligence startup xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure.\nMicrosoft, being the largest backer of OpenAI, is essentially teaming up with one of its rivals. That relationship has increasingly cooled as Microsoft loosens its reliance on the startup and develops its own in-house AI models including MAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no fan of Musk, recently describing him as insecure in an interview, and must be screaming inside. Altman probably is not wrong about Musk’s insecurity, but insecurity is a powerful motivator.\nGizmodo has reached out to xAI for comment. Musk’s companies do not often respond to media inquiries.\nThe details of the new deal with xAI are unclear, like how much money Musk’s startup will commit to the data center venture. xAI has raised $12 billion since its founding in 2023, nearly the same amount as OpenAI, and is reportedly looking to raise another $10 billion. Its data center in Memphis, dubbed Colossus, is said to be the largest in the world with more than one million GPUs powering the Grok chatbot that is deeply integrated into X.\nxAI has received criticism for using gas turbines to feed its significant power demands, and receiving significant concessions from the city of Memphis even though data centers usually do not employ many people, and AI threatens to eliminate jobs. Most companies in the space hope to build out nuclear energy to power their demands, which could be a positive for the green energy transition, but building out nuclear takes many years. In the meantime, President Trump has advocated for building out coal power plants next to data centers.\nEvery company in the artificial intelligence space is racing to build out computing infrastructure they believe will be necessary to stand out in an incredibly competitive field. Forming partnerships could help spread the costs of these expansive projects, and Bloomberg reports that other investors might join the Microsoft-xAI project:\nThe Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments â including energy projects â mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement.\nOpenAI early this year announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank, one of the earlier signs that it was distancing itself from Microsoft. The big tech company has been building out its own in-house models that could be faster and less expensive to run than ChatGPT, and Microsoft likely does not want to be reliant on an independent company for its AI models if the technology is going to be as revolutionary as many in the industry believe. It is better to control your own destiny than rely on a wild and frenetic company like OpenAI, which has seen a slew of scandals and ongoing drama, including the brief ouster of Altman.\nThe whole thing must be very satisfying to Musk, who clearly launched xAI out of jealousy of OpenAI’s sudden and massive rise. He co-founded the startup, after all, but left following disputes surrounding its direction, only to see the company launch ChatGPT and kickstart a new AI generation. Now he is teaming up with OpenAI’s largest backer on his own rival startup. Musk also continues to try and sue OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit company, among other issues. It is viewed as a convenient way to try and slow OpenAI’s growth as he builds a competitor.\nMusk’s close relationship with the Trump administration has aided him significantly, even if it has hurt one leg of his empire, Tesla. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that X is now privately valued at $44 billion, the exact same price he paid for what was then called Twitter back in 2022. Once a bastion of coastal elites, X has become something more of a Republican media outlet and microphone to promote President Trump’s agenda. xAI similarly has had no problems raising funding from sovereign wealth funds and others who want to be close to power. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular AI chatbot in use today with a reported 400 million weekly users and name recognition that none of its competitors enjoy.\nxAI is banking on its access to real-time posts from X to differentiate Grok as a powerful chatbot, even though the social network is littered with misinformation. Grok is deeply integrated with X, with buttons allowing users to ask for more context about specific posts. But the general idea seems to be that cozying up to Trump and making X the town square of the Republican party will support xAI’s rise as a major AI player. The chatbot, like all the others, suffers from serious issues producing accurate responses.\nLast year, Musk gave shares in xAI to investors in his Twitter takeover, as well as preferential access to xAI’s funding rounds, effectively ensuring they would make their money back. The new deal with Microsoft cements xAI as a legitimate player in the AI race. While it remains a major question how impactful AI chatbots will really become in the world, it is understood that should they be as successful as hoped, having access to significant compute will help the few survive. Anyone can run a model like DeepSeek, but “agents” that control computers and do work for users will be resource-intensive, and users will go to competitors if their usage is rate-limited by another.\n\nArtificial intelligenceElon Muskgenerative aiMicrosoftOpenAIxai \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          The Steam Deck's success boils down to ease of use, something that you may soon get on Asus or Lenovo-brand handhelds.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \n\n          The FBI has asked the public to \"look out for suspicious activity in areas occupied by Tesla dealerships.\"\n        \n\n          Company contemplates packing device that tells time with cameras and 'visual intelligence.'\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "If you have been looking for a free alternative to Google Docs, Microsoft might have answered your prayersâor so we thoughtâuntil you see what it won’t let you do.\nBeebom first reported that Microsoft had stealthily launched a free, ad-supported version of the Office app earlier this week, offering limited versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. However, as it turns out, Microsoft was conducting âsome limited testingâ and will not launch a free version of Office after all.\nMicrosoft told PCWorld that it was “conducting some limited testing” and that the company has âno plans to launch a free, ad-supported version of Microsoft Office desktop apps.â Knowing it was a test is a relief since it seems like Microsoft put most of Office’s useful features behind a paywall. This also explains why there was no fanfare around its release.\nThe free ad-supported Office app, available only on Windows PCs, gives you access to the most basic features of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. If you want to do more than the bare minimum, like add images, change fonts, or even adjust line spacing, youâll need to upgrade to a premium version of Office for $100 a year for a single user.\nThatâs not the only caveat; according to Beebom, youâll have to deal with a persistent banner ad at the top right of your document and a 15-second video ad that will play every few hours. On top of that, the original file has to be saved to your OneDrive account before it can be downloaded anywhere else.\nI tried to download the free version of Office on a Windows desktop at home, but it seems itâs unavailable. Even so, considering the limitations of the free Office app and the persistent ads, it might be easier to stick with Google Workspace since chances are you already have a Google account. I’m not the biggest OneDrive fan, so the idea of using it to save my files would have made the free Office a complete non-starter for me.\nMicrosoft wasnât the only one attempting to loosen Google’s tight grip on free work tools.

            "full_content": "On Tuesday morning, some PC gamers woke up to discover their computers were seemingly under threat. A “HackTool” called WinRing0 had suddenly started triggering a Windows Defender alert, as if their PCs were under attack. Some of those computers even began behaving oddly ​​— like blasting their fans at high speed — once the HackTool had been quarantined. I know, because it happened to me. \nBut my computer wasn’t actually under attack. At least, not yet. \nWhen I checked where Windows Defender had actually detected the threat, it was in the Fan Control app I use to intelligently cool my PC. Windows Defender had broken it, and that’s why my fans were running amok. For others, the threat was detected in Razer Synapse, SteelSeries Engine, OpenRGB, Libre Hardware Monitor, CapFrameX, MSI Afterburner, OmenMon, FanCtrl, ZenTimings, and Panorama9, among many others. \n“As of now, all third-party / open-source hardware monitoring softwares are screwed,” Fan Control developer Rémi Mercier tells me. \nThat’s because all these programs have something in common, nine of their developers tell The Verge. They do (or did) all contain a piece of kernel-level software that is indeed called WinRing0. And WinRing0 could genuinely be a threat as of today, one that has even been linked to some pretty nasty real-world malware that could theoretically hijack your PC. \nBut again, that’s not what’s happening on computers with these specific useful apps — there is no hijack underway. Rather, WinRing0 is being flagged because it’s an insecure way for these pieces of monitoring software to tell how fast my PC’s fans are spinning and the colors of its LED lights, among other readings. And yet, WinRing0 is widespread, several developers tell me, because it’s one of the only ways Microsoft and the PC industry let them tap that hardware from inside the Windows operating system. \n“There are only two freely available Windows drivers I know of that are capable of accessing the SMBus registers we need to be able to control LEDs: InpOut32 and WinRing0,” says Adam Honse, developer of OpenRGB. “We used to use InpOut32, but it was conflicting with Riot’s Vanguard anti-cheat, so we switched to WinRing0 as it did not conflict.”\nHonse and others freely admit that WinRing0 could be abused. “It’s not some secret vulnerability. It’s literally a library intended to give userspace applications access to something that only kernel drivers normally have access to,” he says. \nNor do they all begrudge Microsoft’s attempt to close that potential loophole. After the CrowdStrike outage that knocked out 8.5 million devices with a buggy update last year, Microsoft has been under pressure to restrict software that has special access to low level hardware, so nothing like that can happen again. Microsoft hasn’t said why it’s only getting around to addressing WinRing0 now, but it’s been gradually overhauling its driver requirements in yearly updates, and it’s pretty routine for the company to blacklist vulnerabilities on the go. \nThe fact remains that this vulnerable WinRing0 has found its way into all kinds of software because it was a useful loophole, and several developers now say they’re stuck because Microsoft would charge too much to fix it. Some are even calling Windows Defender’s detection a “false positive,” implying it should be safe to use WinRing0 anyhow, because their own apps aren’t malicious and there’s no other cost-effective way to get them working. \nMicrosoft doesn’t entirely seem to disagree. The company has already reportedly walked back its blanket ban on WinRing0 apps, telling The Verge that it’s continuing to investigate. Here’s Microsoft GM of Threat Protection Scott Woodgate:\nWe are aware of reports about gaming and monitoring applications being flagged as a threat due to the use of unsigned versions of the Winring0 driver. While we continue to investigate, Microsoft Defender still assesses unsigned drivers to be a threat and is re-evaluating detection logic to have a more durable coverage without leading into adverse side effects such as false positive.\nMicrosoft did not confirm or deny that it has paused its ban, or comment on whether it might come back. Microsoft would not tell The Verge whether WinRing0 is inherently dangerous, or possibly somewhat safe.\nOne notable developer says it’s absolutely dangerous. Martin Malik, developer of popular system monitoring tool HWiNFO, reached out after we first published to say:\nThe problem with WinRing0 is, that once it’s installed/active in the system it allows unrestricted access to protected resources. So, any app (even without admin rights) can for example use it and say “hey, read (or write) for me this part of memory.” And since the driver has access and doesn’t restrict the range, it can read/change other processes, secrets in memory or protected kernel registers. This is very dangerous.\nMicrosoft didn’t answer our question about whether the above statement is true or false. In the meanwhile, some developers are already claiming it’s safe enough you should feel confident letting it through. “If you wish to utilize the full feature set of CapFrameX, we recommend adding an exception for it in Defender,” reads a message forwarded by CapFrameX founder Mark Fangmeyer to The Verge. “Rest assured, this measure will allow seamless functionality without compromising security.”\nSignalRGB founder Timothy Sun says the security risk was too much for his company, though. “Since WinRing0 installs system-wide, we realized we were dependent on whatever version was first installed on a user’s system. This made it extremely difficult to verify whether other applications had installed potentially vulnerable versions, effectively putting our users at risk despite our best efforts,” he says. \nThat’s why he invested in SignalRGB’s own RGB interface instead, eventually ditching WinRing0 in 2023 in favor of a proprietary SMBus driver. But the developers I spoke to, including Sun, agree that’s an expensive proposition. \n“I won’t sugarcoat it — the development process was challenging and required significant engineering resources,” says Sun. “Small open source projects do not have the financial ability to go that route, nor dedicated Microsoft kernel development experience to do so,” says OpenRGB’s Honse.\nSome suggest there may be a simpler alternative: why not fix the vulnerability in WinRing0 itself? To my surprise, three developers tell me that WinRing0 has already been patched, but the open source community doesn’t believe they can afford to get a new version signed by Microsoft — and without Microsoft’s digital signature, Windows won’t let users install it to begin with.\nWinRing0 “was a ‘one of its kind driver’ in that its source was open and it was signed,” Mercier explains. “Nothing else like it exists, as enterprises do not develop open-source kernel drivers.” \nAccording to PhyxionNL, the developer of the popular Libre Hardware Monitor that underpins many monitoring apps (including Fan Control), WinRing0 dates back to a time when Windows didn’t require Microsoft to sign such drivers; its author Noriyuki Miyazaki (also see: CrystalDiskMark) apparently signed it himself.\nBut to get a new copy signed, developers would need Microsoft’s approval — and they’d need to pay up. \nIt is not feasible to demand not-for-profit hobby [free open source software] projects to pay the same costs for driver signing as for-profit companies. It also appears that driver signing is a limited-time thing that would need continuous renewal, so it would be a recurring cost. Also, from preliminary searching, you need to be a company to be able to even get a kernel signing certificate. Microsoft has stacked the deck against us.\nOmenMon’s Piotr Szczepanski says it’s not good enough to submit your entire app to Microsoft and VirusTotal for inspection, either, “as despite OmenMon being whitelisted each time, eventually the exact same executable can become repeatedly flagged again, as definition versions get updated and signatures get purged.”\n“Microsoft has stacked the deck against us.”\nSzczepanski, ZenTimings’ Ivan Rusanov, and Fan Control’s Mercier all say there’s nothing they can really afford to do in the absence of a newly signed driver that functions like WinRing0. “I would definitely replace it with something else the moment it gets available, but for now, obviously, I can’t advise the users to ignore it and add an exception to Defender,” says Rusanov. \nBut there is some hope. Prebuilt gaming PC manufacturer iBuyPower, whose Hyte Nexus monitoring software also uses WinRing0 and got flagged by Windows Defender, tells The Verge it will endeavor to get an updated WinRing0 signed — and give the results back to developers. \n“If this solution works, we’ll share our updated and signed version of the library, so the community of developers can distribute new versions of their apps with validated Microsoft drivers,” Hyte product director Robert Teller tells us. \nTeller says he’s awaiting Microsoft’s reply. Microsoft didn’t have any comment for The Verge.\nI asked SignalRGB’s Sun if he might share his proprietary SMBus driver, but he said no, as “we’ve invested significant resources into developing this solution specifically for our needs and user base.”\nHWiNFO’s Malik warns, though, that signing a patched WinRing0 won’t address the underlying risk, because the patch only addresses accessing the driver without admin elevation, which could be as simple as fooling a user into clicking yes. Microsoft would not answer whether that’s true, and whether WinRing0 is inherently a threat.\n“Creating a reliable and secure driver is the most complicated thing as it requires complete rewrite of driver, interface to user-mode and also the application. Such driver needs to be tailored to particular application’s needs, so it would be quite difficult to also create a driver that would fit multiple apps,” he says.\nAs for Razer and Steelseries users, you may simply want to update your software to the latest version to avoid WinRing0, as both companies tell me they’ve recently ditched it. But know that you may lose some functionality as a result. Steelseries has just removed its System Monitor app entirely to address the vulnerability, meaning gamers can no longer see system data on the screens of its peripherals.\nRazer software VP Quyen Quach says Synapse 4 and Synapse 2 never used WinRing0 at all and that the company patched Synapse 3 to remove it just three weeks ago.\nCorrection, March 13th: Razer says Synapse 2 didn’t use WinRing0 either, so no current versions of Synapse are affected.\nUpdate, March 17th: Added statements from Microsoft and HWiNFO’s Malik, and that Microsoft would not answer our specific fact-check questions.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "In its latest AI challenge, Apple is facing a false advertisement lawsuit citing delays in delivering its artificial intelligence features.\nThe complaint, filed Wednesday by Malibu-based Clarkson Law Firm in the US District Court in San Jose, accuses Apple of unfair competition, false advertising, and negligent misrepresentation.\n\"Consumers are excited about AI, and unfortunately that has led to Big Tech overpromising and underdelivering,\" Timothy Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm, said in a statement to Business Insider.\nThe plaintiffs in the class action suit, led by customer Peter Landsheft and other iPhone 16 owners, said Apple took \"advantage of consumers' desire for cutting-edge artificial intelligence software and features on their phones,\" and didn't deliver on all of the Apple Intelligence tools that were announced ahead of its iPhone 16 launch.\nSince the September rollout, the iPhone 16 has been advertised as the first iPhone \"built for AI,\" and Apple Intelligence appears in a number of ads for the device. The tech is only available on iPhone 15 Pro models or later; the iPhone 16 lineup starts at $799.\nBut in a rare move, Apple announced earlier this month that Siri's planned AI upgrade, which was demonstrated months before the latest iPhone released, would take longer than expected. The plaintiffs referenced an ad from September featuring actor Bella Ramsey using a more personalized version of Siri.\nNow, it's facing claims that it \"overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented,\" the lawsuit says.\nThe tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence almost a year ago at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2024. Apple showcased an AI-powered iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other genAI capabilities set to release that fall.\nApple Intelligence launched in October, one month after the iPhone 16 came out. The complaint says \"Apple's mirage of innovation\" included a personalized Siri assistant that can handle complex tasks and cross-reference iOS apps, a feature that Apple said will roll out in the \"coming year.\"\nApple's play to catch up with AI rivals like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and boost iPhone sales has also incited criticism of what it's delivered so far and questions about what's to come.\nIn 2024, \"Apple showed a demo, and it only does demos when things are nearly done, and it said it would ship 'later this year' and it never misses deadlines like that. So we should be using it, today,\" analyst Benedict Evans wrote in a blog post.\nInternally, it seems that Apple is making changes to get things moving along in the AI department. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell would replace AI head John Giannandrea in overseeing Siri.\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\nThe suit itself may not be enough to hurt Apple shares, but spotlighting its \"failure\" to deliver an AI-boosted Siri on time is a \"threat to Apple's market value,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told BI.\nApple has no place to hide now that competitors' genAI chatbots are up and running, he added."

            "full_content": "﻿Annie and Jeff Strain filed a lawsuit in January\nPrytania Media owners Annie and Jeff Strain are suing NetEase for defamation, unfair trade practices, and interference with business relations, which the lawsuit says led to the destruction of the company and its multiple subsidiaries: Crop Circle Games, Possibility Space, Fang & Claw, and Dawon Entertainment. Each of these studios shut down in 2024, and the Strains laid off all their employees; in the case of both Crop Circle and Possibility Space, the Strains blamed the closure on staff allegedly leaking information about their studios to the press (and in particular, an unpublished Kotaku story about Possibility Space) and an inability to get funding.\nNetEase, for its part, was an investor in Crop Circle Games. Per documents filed in court, Prytania Media owned approximately 75% of that particular subsidiary, and NetEase owned 25%. Both Annie and Jeff Strain resigned from their positions within the studio when filing the lawsuit, leaving NetEase executive Chenglin Han the remaining board member. Technically, the lawsuit was also filed against Crop Circle — bringing Han in as the remaining board member. Attorney Michael Magner, representing NetEase, said in accompanying documents that suing Crop Circle is “effectively suing themselves to defeat diversity jurisdiction — a tactic that is improper, fraudulent, and an inadequate basis to defeat diversity jurisdiction.”\nThe lawsuit, which Polygon has reviewed, was filed in January in Louisiana state court before NetEase filed for the case to be moved to federal court in March. In a letter sent to NetEase CEO Ding Lei in January, Steven Griffith, Jr., representing Prytania Media and the Strains, claimed that NetEase “spread false and defamatory statements that caused the demise of Prytania Media.” In the lawsuit, he said, they’re seeking $900 million in damages, triple an earlier $300 million valuation of the company. Griffith also alleged that NetEase, and in particular the NetEase employee Han, spread “defamatory rumors” that suggested Prytania Media was engaging in financial fraud. The Strains blame NetEase for any issues, suggesting that NetEase wasn’t interested in complying with the United States Department of the Treasury regulations.\n“I can share details in our next call, but the high level message is we want to keep away from the radar of [the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] which can be quite tricky,” Griffith attributed to a NetEase representative in the letter. “Geopolitical stuff is already causing trouble to our business efforts in North America, truth to be told.”\nAddressing the lawsuit, NetEase provided the following statement to Polygon:\nThe allegations by Prytania Media and its founders Annie and Jeff Strain are wholly without merit, and we emphatically deny and will vigorously defend ourselves against them. Our record as a global gaming company speaks for itself, and we remain committed to conducting business with integrity. We are confident that the legal process will vindicate our position and shed light on the real reasons behind the demise of the Strains’ studios.\nThe Strains say they urged NetEase to be compliant with U.S. law regarding its Crop Circle investment, but that NetEase representatives “became increasingly hostile and aggressive.” They assert that NetEase is hesitant to comply with these laws because it’d have to “identify owners and board members that are Members of the [Chinese Communist Party] and their position within the CCP, as well as the existence of its CCP party organizations, it [sic] members, and the control it exerts over NetEase.” The lawsuit also claims NetEase “dodged confirming its compliance” in the U.S. because NetEase executives wanted to emigrate to the U.S., including Lei, who allegedly intended to move into a $29 million mansion purchased from Elon Musk.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the rumors about financial mismanagement, which eventually spread to the press, were an attempt on the part of NetEase to “silence Prytania Media’s concerns.” The Strains say they learned about these rumors when an investor, Transcend Fund, reached out with concerns of “fraud and misuse of funds” within Crop Circle Games. Andrew Sheppard, the managing director of the fund, allegedly confirmed that the report was from NetEase. From the lawsuit:\nNetEase told this gaming company that Crop Circle Games “was investigating fraudulent activities” on several bases. First, it was stated, incorrectly, that “[f]unds had been moved from Crop Circle Games to other subsidiaries without prior consent of relevant stakeholders.” Second, “quarterly financials [were] potentially materially inaccurate.” Lastly, NetEase asserted that “many key appointments [had] been let go” since “the potential leak” of the foregoing inaccurate information.\nThe Strains further deny that “key employees” were let go because of the leak, “but because of the financial state of the company.” Transcend eventually requested “full access to all financial and audit information.” As the information spread, the Strains said, investors pulled out of discussions with both Crop Circle and Fang & Claw. “One by one, each of Prytania Media’s studios had to be closed,” lawyers wrote in the suit. “Ultimately, Prytania Media itself had to be shut down.”\nPossibility Space was shut down in April 2024, preceded by Crop Circle. The other studios that were part of Prytania Media followed. “There was not a single organization of any kind willing to invest in continued game development,” Annie Strain wrote in a now-deleted post on the Crop Circle website. The dissolution of these studios came as a surprise to their employees, who were all laid off without notice, per reports.\nPrytania Media was founded by Annie and Jeff Strain in 2021, building off the success of Jeff Strain’s first studio, ArenaNet. ArenaNet was founded in 2000 and is best known for Guild Wars. Jeff Strain moved on to found Undead Labs in 2009 and release State of Decay. Undead Labs was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 and came under fire in 2022 for alleged “sexism, bullying, and burnout,” per a Kotaku report. Before founding these studios, Jeff Strain worked at Blizzard Entertainment on the likes of StarCraft, Diablo, and World of Warcraft. \nPrytania Media was sued in August 2024 by Omnipresent Group, an employee management and human resources company, for “failing to pay the invoices rendered.” In March 2024, Omnipresent terminated its contract with Prytania Media. The company owes Omnipresent $212,019.18; in court documents, Prytania Media accepted the judgment and settlement amount of $218,250. That was in October 2024, and by December 2024, Omnipresent filed documents saying Prytania Media did not meet the deadline for payment.\nThe Strains’ lawsuit against NetEase has been assigned to a judge in federal court. Polygon has reached out to both sides for comment.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include new details from a separate lawsuit against Prytania Media, as well as a statement from NetEase.\nThe best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\nGlobal payments giant Visa operates in 200-plus countries and territories, all with their own unique, complex rules and regulations. \nIts client services team must understand those nuances when policy-related questions come up — like ‘are we allowed to process this type of payment in this country?’ — but it’s simply not humanly possible to know all those answers top-of-mind. \nThis means they’ve typically had to track down relevant information manually — an exhaustive process that can take days depending on how accessible it is. \nWhen generative AI emerged, Visa saw this as a perfect use case, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to not only pull out information up to 1,000X faster, but cite it back to its sources. \n“First of all, it’s better quality results,” Sam Hamilton, Visa’s SVP of data and AI, told VentureBeat. “It’s also latency, right? They can handle a lot more cases than they were able to before.”\nThis is just one way Visa is using gen AI to enhance its operations — supported by a deliberately-built, tiered tech stack — while managing risk and keeping fraud at bay. \nNovember 30, 2022, the day ChatGPT was introduced to the world, will go down in history as a pivotal moment for AI. \nNot long thereafter, Hamilton noted, “employees at Visa were all asking, ‘Where is my chatGPT?’ ‘Can I use ChatGPT?’ ‘I don’t have access to ChatGPT.’ ‘I want ChatGPT.’”\nHowever, as one of the world’s largest digital payments providers, Visa naturally had concerns about its customers’ sensitive data — specifically, that it remained secure, out of the public domain and wouldn’t be used for future model training.  \nTo meet employee demand while balancing these concerns, Visa introduced what it calls ‘Secure ChatGPT,’ which sits behind a firewall and runs internally on Microsoft Azure. The company can control input and output via data loss prevention (DLP) screening to ensure no sensitive data is leaving Visa’s systems. \n“All the hundreds of petabytes of data, everything is encrypted, everything is secure at rest and also in transport,” Hamilton explained.\nDespite the name, Secure ChatGPT is a multi-model interface offering six different options: GPT (and its various iterations), Mistral, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, Google’s Gemini and IBM’s Granite. Hamilton described this as model-as-a-service or RAG-as-a-service. \n“Think of that as a kind of a layer where we can provide an abstraction,” he said. \nInstead of people building their own vector databases, they can pick and choose the API that best fits their particular use case. For instance, if they just need a little bit of fine-tuning, they’ll typically choose a smaller open-source model like Mistral; by contrast, if they’re looking for more of a sophisticated reasoning model, they can choose something like OpenAI o1 or o3. \nThis way, people don’t feel constrained or as if they’re missing out on what’s readily available in the public domain (which can lead to ‘shadow AI,’ or the use of unapproved models). Secure GPT is “nothing more than a shell on top of the model,” Hamilton explained. “Now they can pick the model they want on top of that.” \nBeyond Secure ChatGPT, all Visa developers are given access to GitHub Copilot to assist in their day to day coding and testing. Developers use Copilot and plugins for various integrated development environments (IDEs) to understand code, enhance code and perform unit testing (determining that code runs as intended), Hamilton noted. \n“So the code coverage [identifying areas where proper testing is lacking] increases significantly because we have this assistant,” he said. \nOne of the most potent use cases for Secure ChatGPT is the handling of policy-related questions specific to a given region. \n“As you can imagine, being in 200 countries with different regulations, documents could be thousands and thousands, hundreds of thousands,” Hamilton noted. “That gets really complicated. You need to nail that, right? And it needs to be an exhaustive search.” \nNot to mention, local policy changes over time, so Visa’s experts must be up-to-date. \nNow with a robust RAG grounded in reliable, up-to-date data, Visa’s AI not only quickly retrieves answers, but provides citations and source materials. “It tells you what you can do or cannot do, and says, ‘Here is the document that you want, I’m giving an answer based on that,’” Hamilton explained. “We have narrowed answers with the knowledge that we have built into the RAG.” \nNormally, the exhaustive process would take “if not hours, days” to draw concrete conclusions. “Now I can get that in five minutes, two minutes,” said Hamilton. \nThese capabilities are the result of Visa’s heavy investment in data infrastructure over the last 10 years: The finance giant has spent around $3 billion on its tech stack, according to Hamilton. \nHe describes that stack as a “birthday cake with 4 layers”: The foundation is a ‘data-platform-as-a-service layer, with ‘data-as-a-service,’ an AI and machine learning (ML) ecosystem and data services and products layers built on top. \nData-platform-as-a-service essentially serves as an operating system built on a data lake that aggregates “hundreds of petabytes of data,” Hamilton explained. The layer above, data-as-a-service, serves as a sort of “data highway” with multiple lanes going at different speeds to power hundreds of applications. \nLayer three, the AI/ML ecosystem, is where Visa continuously tests models to ensure they are performing the way they should be, and are not susceptible to bias and drift. Finally, the fourth layer is where Visa builds products for employees and clients. \nBeing a trusted payment provider, one of Visa’s top priorities is fraud prevention, and AI is playing an increased role here, as well. Hamilton explained that the company has invested more than $10 billion to help reduce fraud and increase network security. Ultimately, this helped the company block $40 billion in attempted fraud in 2024 alone.\nFor instance, a new Visa deep authorization tool provides transaction risk scoring to help manage card-not-present (CNP) payments (such as when users pay via web or mobile app, as is everyday practice for all of us). This is powered by a deep learning recurrent neural network (RNN) model based on petabytes of contextual data. Similarly, real-time, account-to-account payment protection (think via digital wallets or instant payment systems) — is enabled by deep learning AI models that produce instant risk scores and automatically block bad transactions. \nHamilton explained that Visa used a transformer-based model — a neural network that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in data — to enhance these tools and quickly identify and thwart fraud. “We wanted to do that in line with the transactions,” he said. “That means we have less than a second, I should say milliseconds, response times.” \nSynthetic data provides value in fraud prevention, as well: Hamilton’s team augments existing data with synthetic data to perform simulations around newer enumerations of fraud. “That helps us learn what’s happening now and what could happen in the short term and long term, so we can simulate and train the model to catch the data,” he said.  \nHe noted that fraud is an arms race — and there’s a very low barrier to entry for threat actors. “We need to be a step ahead of that and anticipate and block them,” Hamilton emphasized. \nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

The move has also come amid an overall shift in the tech industry toward more rigor and less coddling of employees.\nOne of Nadella's first big leadership moves after he took the helm in 2014 was to name Hogan as Microsoft's chief people officer.\nHogan has served in the role since then, helping Nadella craft a new workplace management system around the concept of a \"growth mindset,\" the idea that employees develop skills through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a \"fixed mindset,\" which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure.\n\"Kathleen and I have been discussing this transition and succession planning for some time, and we both agree this is the critical juncture to apply new focus and intention to this work,\" Nadella wrote in an email to employees announcing the change.\nColeman, the incoming chief people officer, is likely to have a big impact on the redesign of Microsoft's performance review process."

I saw the same thing happen with the rise of PCs and a refusal to acknowledge technology and techniques that mainframes have deployed successfully for decades. Instead we saw data centers and chip makers ignore IBM, Cray, Sperry Rand, and others only to reinvent the wheel. With painful and incompatible iterations on virtualization support and address translation, which is still full of holes to this day.\nNo one broke email. The problem was more fundamental and affected email among many other things.\nAt least for those federal employees who need to be sending Melon their weekly report if they don't want to get fired.\nHaven't they told 'roman salute guy' to fudge off back to South Africa yet?\nEmail is down.

In an announcement on Thursday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) said the chip, called Ocelot, can “reduce the costs of implementing quantum error correction by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.”\nQuantum computing errors are one of the biggest challenges in the industry. Unlike traditional computers, quantum computing replaces binary 1s and 0s with qubits, a unit that can exist in multiple states at the same time. As noted by Amazon, qubits are “sensitive to the smallest changes, or ‘noise’ in their environment,” such as vibrations, heat, and electromagnetic interference, making it “extremely challenging to build quantum computers that can perform reliable, error-free calculations of any significant complexity.”\nInstead of adding more qubits to correct these errors, Amazon built error correction into its Ocelot chip with what it calls “cat qubits” (named after the Schrödinger’s cat experiment). These qubits are supposed to reduce the amount of energy and resources used for quantum error correction as they “intrinsically suppress” certain kinds of errors.\n“We didn’t take an existing architecture and then try to incorporate error correction afterwards,” Oskar Painter, Amazon Web Services’ director of quantum hardware, said in the press release. “We selected our qubit and architecture with quantum error correction as the top requirement.”\nThe approach differs from what Google and Microsoft are doing to reduce errors in quantum computing. In December, Google announced its Willow quantum computing chip, which can perform a computing challenge in less than five minutes. The company’s researchers also found that introducing more qubits into the system can help reduce errors. Meanwhile, Microsoft recently announced its Majorana 1 quantum computing processor, which it claims can “scale to a million qubits on a single chip” while reducing errors.\nAmazon says its Ocelot chip is still a prototype, but the chip’s more efficient architecture could potentially allow for smaller quantum computers that use less resources.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "The acquisition is Alphabet’s biggest yet, after a $23 billion takeover attempt stalled last year.\nThe acquisition is Alphabet’s biggest yet, after a $23 billion takeover attempt stalled last year.\nby  Dominic Preston and  Jess Weatherbed\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, has announced its largest-ever acquisition, entering into a deal to buy New York-based cybersecurity firm Wiz, making it a part of its Google Cloud division. This is the company’s second attempt to buy Wiz after talks stalled last year at a lower $23 billion evaluation.\nWiz is a fast-growing Israeli-founded startup that works with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to provide cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. The company was valued at $12 billion in May 2024, which reportedly climbed to $16 billion later in the year in an equity offering to employees, and has been working towards an initial public offering (IPO) in the months since the previous acquisition fell through. Should the deal receive regulatory approval, it will easily outsize the $12.5 billion paid by Google for Motorola Mobility in 2012. \n“We expect this change to enable us to execute and innovate even faster,” said Wiz cofounder and CEO Assaf Rappaport in a blog post. “Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company.”\nLast year’s purchase fell through after Wiz’s directors and investors were worried it would fall foul of antitrust requirements, according to the Financial Times. This deal will still face scrutiny, but Alphabet and Wiz will hope that the current US administration and new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Andrew Ferguson, will take a lighter touch. However, Ferguson has previously indicated that he still intends to be firm with big tech and is continuing an antitrust probe into Microsoft.\nPerhaps to head off antitrust concerns, Google has confirmed that Wiz’s products will continue to be available across competitor cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud. “Wiz needs to remain a multicloud platform,” Rappaport adds. The Google Cloud Marketplace will also offer a selection of other security services beyond those provided by Wiz.\nGoogle is currently embroiled in two separate antitrust lawsuits with the Justice Department over its search engine and digital advertising businesses. It lost the first but is appealing the ruling, and a final decision is still awaited on the second.\nThe Wiz purchase is the latest of several acquisitions that Google has made in recent years as it attempts to bolster security for its cloud computing customers. In 2022, Google purchased two cybersecurity firms — Siemplify and Mandiant — for $500 million and $5.4 billion, respectively, with the latter company best recognized for uncovering the SolarWinds hack. Adding Wiz to that mix feels like a targeted effort to tighten Google’s cloud protections in the face of Microsoft’s less-than-stellar cybersecurity reputation.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Microsoft is cooking up something to rival the competition.\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\nMicrosoft is reportedly beginning to test an experimental search results mode for users backed by its AI software.\nIn a statement, Microsoft confirmed the start of this \"AI-powered search mode\" to Windows Latest; however, the company declined to explain further (via 9to5Google). The publication turned to an unnamed source, which provided more insight into how Bing's \"AI Search\" could work once it's rolled out.\nA key aspect of this mode is the engine will leverage Microsoft's Copilot software for a view that's loaded with all the information a user could want for a subject.\nThe publication states Copilot will \"summarize\" everything about the user's question without the user needing to scour the web. When receiving answers, AI Search will provide a brief explainer before diving into organized pieces of information. The post states when asking about the safety of \"Windows 11 24H2,\" AI Search broke things down by \"update safety, risks, and compatibility checks.\"\nBing's AI Search view will supposedly be clean, offering only your question with the AI and the results that follow. Early tests show the right side will offer tabs for \"Images\" and \"Video,\" while the UI's bottom gives you suggested (relevant) follow-up questions and the ability to write one yourself.\nThe publication's source highlights another key aspect of \"AI Search:\" the removal of all website links. Supposedly, the Copilot AI will do all of the heavy lifting, sourcing information for users and displaying it in a digestible format.\nMoreover, Copilot will cite where it got its information at the end of its summary. Users can click on them for fact-checking, similar to what Google's done with AI Overviews.\nGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android\nThe biggest thing about Microsoft's confirmed \"AI Search\" development is that it mirrors what Google is reportedly creating for Search. Earlier this month, a report surfaced stating Google was working on an \"AI Mode\" for Search, which mirrors a typical conversation with Gemini. This \"alternate\" mode will supposedly offer organized answers with defined headers for \"complex questions.\"\nUsers can swap to this mode, likely in the same manner as you would switch to see image results or news.\nThe rumored example of Google's AI Mode is reminiscent of what we've seen rumored for Microsoft Bing. The page will be void of site links, only offering the information discovered/summarized by a \"custom\" version of the Gemini 2.0 model.\nRegarding Microsoft, the company launched Copilot in January 2024 with OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 models as its backbone. It's also worth noting Microsoft nabbed Google's DeepMind co-founder last year to further its new journey into AI. Mustafa Suleyman was brought on to oversee everything dealing with Microsoft AI, meaning what's coming up via \"AI Search\" could be the fruit of their hard work.\nNickolas is always excited about tech and getting his hands on it.

The Verge can also confirm that Meta is working on the standalone app. The new app could launch in the second quarter of this year, CNBC says, joining the growing number of standalone AI apps, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot.\nMeta has already brought its AI chatbot across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, but launching a standalone app could help the company reach people who don’t already use those platforms. Similar to rival chatbots, Meta AI can answer questions, generate images, edit photos, and more. It recently gained the ability to use its “memory” to provide better recommendations.\nIn a response to CNBC’s report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joked, “ok fine maybe we’ll do a social app.” Meta declined to comment.\nMeta has ramped up its efforts to compete in the AI industry in recent months, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing plans to invest up to $65 billion to further the company’s AI ambitions.

            "full_content": "You'll need an active Microsoft 365 account to access the new AI features across these apps.\n  \nYou now need a Microsoft subscription for image generation.\nFor the first time ever, you'll need a paid subscription to access some features in Microsoft apps Notepad and Paint. Newer artificial intelligence capabilities have been added to these apps, such as an image generator in Paint and AI rewriting of text in Notepad, and -- as reported by PC World earlier this year -- they'll require a paid Microsoft 365 account.\nMicrosoft posted some details about the new AI features on one of its blogs back in November.\nIt seems as if paywalling the AI features would not affect the ability for Windows users who don't have a 365 subscription to access and use the apps for everything else. Features that are not accessible due to a lack of a subscription may be grayed out in the apps. A representative for Microsoft said the company had no additional comment.\nRam Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, said that Microsoft's AI move amounts to a freemium strategy that may help build demand for those features. But in the era of AI, there are more variable costs involved with using large-language models for such tasks. \n\"This makes delivering new AI features for free a loss-making proposition,\" Bala told CNET. \"Usage-based pricing is going to be much more prevalent for AI products where token usage is a major cost factor for companies.\" \nBala said that we'll be seeing more examples of tech companies trying to find a way to price AI-based services. \n\"This goes beyond Microsoft. GPT APIs involve token-based pricing, but Mistral recently introduced an OCR product which charges $1 per 1,000 pages,\" Bala noted. \"Companies are going to be experimenting with other forms of resource usages such as number of sessions.\"\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions of dollars in one of the industry's AI leaders, OpenAI, has been introducing AI features into different apps and services, including its Xbox gaming division, and voice and reasoning features for Windows via its Copilot app. Some of the additions have driven up prices in some regions for Microsoft 365, the subscription service it offers for about $10 a month or $99 a year.\nNot all of Microsoft's AI efforts have been met with enthusiasm from users. The Copilot feature Recall, which takes snapshots of a user's activities in order to improve search, was delayed, with Microsoft defending itself against claims that the app was a privacy and security nightmare. In December, news emerged that Recall could capture information such as credit card numbers and social security numbers in the course of taking screenshots of user activity."

An anonymous tipster has shared an internal video from Sony’s PlayStation group with The Verge that demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy from Horizon Forbidden West. After we published this story, the video was pulled from YouTube due to a copyright claim from Muso, a copyrights enforcement company which advertises Sony Interactive Entertainment (aka PlayStation) as a client.\nThe video is narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment who works on video game technology, AI, computer vision, and face technology for Sony’s PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. We watched Raghoebardajal demonstrate an AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay.\nAloy could be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements, both in a demo setting and within the full Horizon Forbidden West game. Raghoebardajal makes it clear this is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate the technology internally at Sony.\nThe technology demo uses OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sony’s has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sony’s own Mockingbird technology.\nWhile the demo is seen running on PC, Sony has also experimented with running parts of this technology directly on PS5 consoles with “little overhead,” according to Raghoebardajal. Sony first demonstrated this internally a year ago, before showing a more advanced version behind closed doors at its Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) in Tokyo in November.\n“This is just a glimpse of what is possible,” says Raghoebardajal. This tech demo doesn’t answer the more obvious questions over whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when you’re supposed to be playing as her in Horizon Forbidden West, or the impact such a technology could have on voice actors and game developers.\nThe video above was pulled after The Verge published our story; you can see an animation above.\nNvidia has been working on its own similar technology for AI-powered NPCs in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Ace, as Nvidia calls it, has been demonstrated several times throughout 2024, and the GPU maker has even worked with Inworld AI to create Covert Protocol, a playable tech demo of Nvidia’s AI game technology.\nMicrosoft has also been partnering closely with Inworld AI to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.\nThere is already a lot of fear among game developers and studios about how AI could impact the creative process of making video games, particularly when so many layoffs are impacting the gaming industry. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 survey said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them.\nSony’s experiments with AI-powered PlayStation characters are bound to generate more conversation around the role of AI in video game creation, just ahead of GDC next week in San Francisco. We reached out multiple times to Sony for a comment on this leaked internal video, but the company didn’t respond. We’ve asked again to confirm whether Sony pulled the video, and if it has further comment.\nUpdate, March 10th: Added that the video has been pulled by a copyright agent which counts PlayStation as a client.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

El gigante tecnológico ha enviado invitaciones para conmemorar el aniversario con una celebración exclusiva para los empleados y actualizaciones importantes sobre Copilot. Satya Nadella, director ejecutivo de Microsoft, y Mustafá Sulaymán, jefe de Microsoft AI, dirigirán las presentaciones, acompañados por líderes del pasado y el presente de la empresa.\nEl evento se produce en un momento en el que se rumorea que Microsoft está desarrollando modelos de lenguaje para competir con OpenAI. Conocidos internamente como MAI, se especula que esta familia incluye un modelo de razonamiento capaz de hacer frente a o1. Los informes indican que Microsoft planea integrar MAI en Copilot como un posible sucesor de GPT-4o\nLa estrategia de desarrollar modelos de IA internos se alinea con la visión a largo plazo de Microsoft, quien busca reducir la dependencia de terceros. Al mismo tiempo, la tecnológica quiere mantener un control más estricto sobre su infraestructura de inteligencia artificial. La presencia de Mustafá Sulaymán como uno de los presentadores principales ha abierto la puerta a rumores.\nSi bien los detalles sobre MAI siguen siendo especulativos, se espera que Microsoft revele su hoja de ruta para la próxima década. Las demostraciones de nuevas funcionalidades de Copilot y las asociaciones estratégicas también pueden estar en la agenda.\nUn reporte de The Information afirma que Microsoft podría integrar DeepSeek, Grok y otros modelos de terceros a Copilot, una decisión que terminaría con la exclusividad de OpenAI. La relación simbiótica, que alguna vez fue una piedra angular del avance de la IA generativa, se ha fracturado en los últimos meses. OpenAI no está satisfecha con las promesas de Microsoft y está buscando una salida del acuerdo.\nSegún los rumores, la manzana de la discordia es la infraestructura de Azure que sustenta los modelos de OpenAI. Las optimizaciones y cambios arquitectónicos de Azure AI ha resultado en una disparidad de latencia que afecta el rendimiento de los modelos de lenguaje. OpenAI ha intentado romper la exclusividad y buscar a otros proveedores, sin embargo, los términos del acuerdo se lo impiden.\nLa compañía dirigida por Sam Altman tampoco estuvo de acuerdo con la contratación de Mustafá Sulaymán como director ejecutivo de Microsoft AI. Sulaymán, cofundador de DeepMind y una figura polémica en la industria, ha generado descontento entre las filas de OpenAI tras discutir con algunos de sus empleados. La relación entre ambas empresas no es la mejor, por lo que se rumorea que Microsoft ya evalúa un futuro sin ChatGPT."

When was it actually possible to buy a new computer that came with the newest version of Windows? Anyone who bought their current computer a day before that date (and quite possibly some months after) are being told to trash machines that are only about three and a half years old.\nThe amount of electronic waste being generated by this is obscene.\nI think it'd be more telling to look at the newest computer that can't run Windows 11.\nIt's really the age of the oldest computer Windows 11 supports. That's apparently eighth generation Intel processors, which were released in 2017, and similar for Ryzen 2000. The unsupported seventh generation was discontinued in late 2020. So you could have a three to three and a half year old computer that's not supported. Maybe worse depending on how long it took those last seventh generation processors to wash through the pipeline.\nI bought my daughter an 11th gen Intel PC and it was not compatible with Windows 11 because the BIOS didn't support TPM out of the box. As a technical person I was able to find and flash a new bios to fix this issue, how many non-technical people are just going to get stuck without even realizing they can fix the issue.\nWindows 10 is nearly a decade old. Windows 10 was released almost a decade ago. It has been continuously updated since then, originally 4 releases per year if you recall.Indeed, it was going to be the last version of Windows. Then Windows 11 was announced, with steep hardware requirements that didn't actually do anything for users.In another age, Best Buy sold a computer that would never be obsolete.

You, the renter have to deal with the HOA/Strata council thru the absentee landlord who doesn't do jack.\nLikewise you might live on the west coast, but your true landlord is some dippity doo in Florida.\nI'm not 100% against the idea of renting, but it needs to be a two-way conversation, and many landlords just a \nWhatever.

Or, and it doesn't need a Microsoft account either. Just saying.\nAnd Windows 10 LTSC will be supported until 2029 at the very least.\nBut they could change that tomorrow if that aligns with their pivot to... whatever comes after the collapse of the AI craze.\nWindows 11 LTSC is also meant for kiosks, payment terminals, etc., and businesses really love to save money, so no, those requirements are unlikely to return.\nIt also doesn't make sense to enable it for Windows updates - Microsoft wouldn't want its customers' PCs to become unbootable.\nDon't you need an underlying pro license to add enterprise ltsc? And isn't LTSC volume license only, minimum 5 copies, and subscription.\nSo if you've got a windows 10 home laptop... you'd need to upgrade to pro and get a 5 license volume license subscription...that'd be absurd.\nEven if you've got 5 laptops around the house, it'd still be absurd. And anyone not already dealing with microsofts volume licensing department would be advised to continue to avoid that hassle. Buying new computers would probably end up cheaper over the long run, and they'd run better because its 5 years newer hardware too.\nOr maybe there is a channel to get on to LTSC that I'm not aware of? I certainly don't pretend to know may way fully around the labyrinthine Deathtrap Dungeon that is Microsoft licensing.\nLet's be real here, chances are you know enough to have knowledge of LTSC and the wherewith all to wipe your machine and install it then that same person likely knows of where to obtain a copy of it and chances are they are not overly concerned with Microsoft's potential loss of a couple dozen bucks.

Reviews ethics statement\n\n    The future of Windows game handhelds can't improve until Microsoft gets involved. Go with a Steam Deck, or wait for the SteamOS version of this handheld.\n  \nMaybe I'd love this handheld more if Windows wasn't on it.\nI was excited to give Lenovo's latest Windows gaming handheld a spin. Seriously. My mind's been changed on PC game handhelds since the Steam Deck won me over. Loading Steam games on the go works surprisingly well on Valve's hardware, which has opened up my ability to play all sorts of games I can't find on the Nintendo Switch. But Lenovo's Legion Go S, a more compact follow-up to Lenovo's previous Legion Go, dumped buckets of water on my excitement. Over a year has gone by, and not much has changed.\nStarting at $730, the Go S isn't cheap, and it isn't small, either. It makes the long, large Steam Deck look compact by comparison. And yet, Lenovo's large 8-inch, higher-res 1,920x1,200-pixel 120Hz display, along with its comfortable analog sticks and buttons and triggers, seemed ready to show me some fun. If only I could play the games I wanted to.\nThe first thing I did was use my Microsoft GamePass Ultimate subscription to download some games to play. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle? I got a graphics/driver error, and it wouldn't run. Forza Horizon 5? It loaded, slowly, and ran at such a terrible frame rate, even with lowered resolution and graphics, that I gave up. Madden 25, a game that won't work on Steam Deck because of EA's anticheat authorization requirements, did technically load up… and was so unplayable and stuttery that I wanted to cry. I lowered my expectations and tried some indie games. Chants of Sennar and Cuphead -- all good there. Is this all Windows handheld gaming can do? If so, Microsoft's Xbox app has no idea how to let me know what works and what doesn't.\nWindows gaming handhelds are held back by one thing: Windows. It's never been clearer after trying out the Lenovo Legion Go S after months and months of Steam Deck gaming. Steam Deck mostly gets out of the way and does its best to deliver games that load decently and play well. My Legion Go S experience has been full of pushy and arcane Windows software, glitchy bugs, games that aren't compatible or games that run so terribly I'd never play them. \nI defaulted to a few of my own indie favorites to play, mainly UFO 50 -- a game I've been addicted to for over half a year. But UFO 50 is a low-lift game graphically. As much as I love it, it's not the reason to spend nearly $800 on a gaming handheld.\nCalling the Legion Go S a \"smaller\" gaming handheld is a misnomer. It's more compact than Lenovo's first Legion Go --which had an 8.8-inch display and detachable wireless controllers, plus a kickstand -- but not by much. I'm surprised how similar the two handhelds still are in size.\nThe Legion Go S has a smaller display, its controls are fixed to its body and there's no kickstand. It's now a pure handheld, much like the Steam Deck. I like the sturdy feel of the Go S's analog sticks, buttons and triggers, but they're not any better than what the Steam Deck has.\nThe Steam Deck OLED (right) looks compact next to the Legion Go S (left).\nThe Steam Deck has control advantages: more buttons (more paddle buttons on the back), better-vibrating haptics and two clickable trackpads. The Legion Go S has a single, tiny trackpad on the right side, which I found hard to use (it's there mainly to help navigate Windows). The handheld's vibrating haptics feel generic; just a flat buzz.\nThe Legion Go S doesn't come with a carrying case, which I'd want. (The Legion Go and Steam Deck both do.) There are vents at the top of the plastic body, and vents all across the back of the handheld. I wouldn't want to get dust in there.\nThere are two USB-C ports, helpful for charging plus connecting to a monitor (or wearable display glasses). The upcoming Nintendo Switch has two USB-C ports too, but the Steam Deck only has one.\nThe Legion Go S (left) feels about as big and thick as the original Legion Go (right), which is surprising since it has a smaller screen and no detachable controllers.\nEverything on the Legion Go S feels laggy. Launching apps takes a while, even Lenovo's software-shell Legion game launcher app. Launching games takes a while, too. Sometimes I wondered if the handheld fell asleep.\nThe onboard AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor isn't an upgrade compared to the Legion Go's Ryzen Z1 Extreme. To be fair, AMD and Lenovo never made great claims that it was a performance improvement. In many cases, I found games ran worse on this handheld than on the OLED Steam Deck. \nSony's Ratchet and Clank wasn't very fun to play on this.\nElden Ring was playable but had more frame rate drops than on my Steam Deck experiences. Sony's Spider-Man 2, which is Steam Deck optimized, ran fine on the Steam Deck but there were glitches and a missing Spider-Man on the Legion Go S. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart also had notable performance drops on Legion Go S compared to Steam Deck. This was after I lowered graphics settings and reduced the Legion Go S's screen resolution down to 1,200x800 pixels, which is the same as the Steam Deck's resolution. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to play games on this in 1,920x1,200 pixels.\nThe Legion Go S's venting fans kick in frequently, pumping heat out of the back and top. Battery life didn't feel great so far either, handling a couple of hours before I felt I needed to recharge. (More battery thoughts below.)\nThere are two USB-C ports on top, and like Steam Deck, its thick design and jutting sides mean you'll need a specific type of carrying case.\nOnce again, Microsoft has failed to optimize its UI or software experience for Windows gaming handhelds. This device loads up straightforward Windows 11, down to Bing spam and your standard Windows software updates. Steam and the Xbox app run as standard Windows applications, with small interface text. I've been spoiled by Valve's handheld-friendly Steam experience on Steam Deck, which is very different.\nI was most disappointed by Microsoft's mishandling of gaming via its own software services. I subscribe to GamePass Ultimate, and I have access to many games that seem to say they'll download onto the Lenovo Legion Go S. Whether they actually run or play in any acceptable manner is up to you to discover. Microsoft doesn't indicate games that are handheld-ready like Steam does. The trial-and-error process for games that can sometimes run 100GB or more in size kills me.\nLower-demand indie games generally run fine. And yes, the flexibility of running Windows 11 means you could run games from any source or game store, or mod this up with your own software like Bazzite (which I've never tried). But then you're tinkering. Is this a tinker gadget? Yeah, I guess so. But I don't want a tinker gadget: I want a gaming handheld that just works. And I have no interest in checking Outlook on this device. \nThere's a cheaper $500 version of Legion Go S running Valve's SteamOS coming later this spring. I haven't seen how it functions yet, but that'll be Valve's first third-party Steam Deck hardware. Based on my experiences so far, that'll be the better option. I don't want to keep playing on the Windows 11 Legion Go S -- or, more accurately, trying to play. It's just not fun, and I need things to work well and be fun when I'm gaming because life is short and the world is challenging, and for upwards of $700 you should get that.\nOr, here's a more straightforward solution: Get the OLED Steam Deck. Going back to it, I appreciated once again how much better it is. Sure, it only runs Steam out of the box, but you can hack around that if you're a tinkering person. At least it works. And right now, we don't expect a new Steam Deck 2 anytime soon.\nNo issue with those buttons, but not wild about that tiny trackpad.\nIf you're interested in handheld gaming regardless of PC compatibility, Nintendo has a new Switch 2 on the way. That won't run your Windows games, but it could be capable of running more PC-like game ports. It's just a sign that the bar for handheld gaming could be raised soon, and it makes devices like this one harder to accept.\nMicrosoft says it'll work on making better Windows gaming handheld experiences this year. I'll believe it when I see it. Right now, there's no reason to get onboard Windows handheld gaming. But PC handheld gaming? Sure, get something SteamOS-based. We'll check in again when we see the Legion Go S in a cheaper, SteamOS-ready form."

            "full_content": "Breaking into the cybersecurity field can be a challenge for some — but 36-year-old Ankit Masrani stumbled into it.\nThe Seattle-based Microsoft employee told Business Insider that while he had plans to become a software engineer, he didn't expect to work in the security space. Now, he develops sovereignty controls for the tech giant's security platform, ensuring sensitive customer information remains within geographic boundaries.\nAfter studying information technology in college and working in roles building software systems, Masrani came to the US to get a Master's degree in computer science. After completing a six-month co-op internship at AWS while he was in school, he converted to a full-time employee, where he focused on securing data and networks until he felt the need for a change.\n\"To be honest, it was very tiring,\" Masrani said about his six and a half years at AWS. \"And I wanted a change in my job to try something different.\"\nMasrani said his final project before joining Microsoft involved building a customer-managed key encryption feature, which required research into best practices for data security. He said he found the work \"really interesting\" and began exploring teams focused on data governance and security. He said working alongside engineers who were truly \"passionate\" about their work was a top priority for him.\nHere's the résumé he used to get his job at Microsoft, where he started on Microsoft's Purview security team as a senior software engineer. Now, he's a principal software engineer working on Microsoft's Security Platform.\nMasrani said he applied by going to the company site and didn't have any references. He said if he were to apply again today, he might not include such a lengthy education section because people would probably focus on his 10 years of experience. When he was a year or two out of school, though, he said he thinks it helped him get interviews.\nMasrani came into the role with a background in IT, computer science, and data experience — all of which are recommended routes to enter the field, according to industry veterans.\nMasrani's pivot wasn't drastic, but he said certain skill sets are needed to transition from general software engineering to the security side.\nAs a software engineer building cybersecurity services, Masrani said he handles large volumes of security logs, user activity data, and threat intelligence data. Masrani said he isn't \"actively doing security threat hunting\" but is building services for a platform that does.\nMasrani said experience with big data technologies like Hadoop, an open source framework that processes large amounts of data for applications, is important for learning how to build data pipelines. He added that machine learning and anomaly detection is also useful for working on security product services.\nMasrani also recommends experience with cloud services like AWS or Microsoft Azure to understand scalable data processing.\n\"Storage is very important since cloud services are leveraged everywhere from small to large software systems,\" Masrani said.\nMasrani also said security knowledge is necessary to pivot to the cybersecurity sector. Masrani said safety protocols and data processing guidelines are often specific to regions.\nHe said domain knowledge around data governance and other security products is important, as well as familiarity with regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation. He said it's also important to know fundamentals around data encryption, network security, and application security.\n\"Any handling of customer data must be done in a safe and secure manner,\" Masrani said. \"Having knowledge of best practices for handling data is very important."

            "full_content": "Melinda French Gates' life may have been very different if not for a conversation she had with an IBM hiring manager in the '80s.\nDuring an interview with LinkedIn News on Tuesday, French Gates said she got a job offer from IBM after completing two summer internships there.\nShe then had a conversation with a hiring manager that made her decide to go to Microsoft — a choice that defined her career and personal life.\n\"My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, 'OK, are you ready to accept the job offer?' I was in person with her, and I said: 'Well, I have one more company to go interview. This little company, Microsoft.' It was tiny,\" French Gates said.\n\"And she said, 'If they give you an offer, you should take it.' And it dumbfounded me. Here's this woman who's supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice, and so when I did get that offer from Microsoft, I really took that to heart,\" she added.\nFrench Gates joined Microsoft as a product manager after graduating from Duke University's business school in 1987.\n\"This is going to be a bit scary. I didn't know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, 'I want to be part of that,'\" French Gates told LinkedIn News.\nFrench Gates worked at Microsoft for nearly a decade, where she rose to the position of general manager and oversaw the company's information products.\nMicrosoft was also where she met her now ex-husband, Bill Gates. The couple married in 1994, and French Gates left Microsoft in 1996. They divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.\nIn May, French Gates announced her departure from the Gates Foundation, a philanthropic foundation she cofounded with Gates in 2000. Her giving efforts are now mainly handled by Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company she founded in 2015.\n\"Many years ago, I received this piece of advice: 'Set your own agenda, or someone else will set it for you.' I've carried those words with me ever since,\" French Gates wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times explaining her decision to leave the Gates Foundation.\nRepresentatives for French Gates didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

El gigante tecnológico anunció que ampliará su iniciativa de ciberseguridad con la introducción de los agentes de Security Copilot, un conjunto de herramientas autónomas diseñadas para reforzar la defensa frente a amenazas latentes. La empresa informa que su plataforma Microsoft Threat Intelligence identifica hasta 7.000 ataques de contraseña por segundo, lo que hace necesarias medidas de seguridad basadas en IA.\nLa expansión de Security Copilot incluye seis agentes de seguridad desarrollados internamente, diseñados para automatizar tareas de seguridad y TI de alto volumen. De acuerdo con una publicación en el blog de seguridad de Microsoft, los agentes proporcionan análisis, triaje y recomendaciones para la remediación de amenazas en tiempo real. Todos operan dentro del modelo de Confianza Cero, garantizando el cumplimiento de estrictas políticas de seguridad.\nSegún Microsoft, los agentes de IA de Security Copilot son proactivos y reducen la carga de trabajo de los equipos de ciberseguridad. Cada uno cumple una función específica, como se detalla a continuación:\nAdemás de las novedades en Security Copilot, Microsoft anunció la implementación de protección antiphishing mejorada para los usuarios de Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Defender para Office 365 ampliará su cobertura a Teams, ofreciendo protección en tiempo real contra URL y archivos adjuntos maliciosos. Esta mejora busca mitigar el número creciente de ataques de phishing dirigidos a clientes como Teams y otras plataformas de colaboración.\nLos agentes autónomos estarán disponibles en vista preliminar para los usuarios de Security Copilot a partir de abril de 2025. Además de este conjunto, Microsoft se asoció con OneTrust, Aviatrix y más para desarrollar agentes de terceros. Estos se especializan en el análisis de filtraciones de datos, fallos en la red, monitoreo en tiempo real y soluciones ante ciberataques."

            "full_content": "When President Donald Trump in January announced a deal with a billionaire in Dubai to build data centers across the US, it immediately raised alarm bells in Indiana.\nTrump said the state and seven others were part of the first phase of the $20 billion foreign investment plan. It could add to Indiana's growing fleet of data centers under construction by companies including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, which need huge amounts of computing power for the artificial intelligence boom. The growth risks saddling residents with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs through higher energy bills.\nThe situation has set off a debate in Indiana over who should foot the bill for the new power plants and transmission infrastructure needed to serve data centers. A bill moving through the Indiana legislature would require tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to cover 80% of project costs, which, if enacted, would make it the first state to do so. At the same time, the bill would allow Indiana utilities to try and pass the costs of building smaller nuclear reactors to customers. Tech companies hope these early-stage energy solutions could someday supply cleaner, around-the-clock power to data centers.\nIt's a mixed bag for Indiana residents that consumer advocacy groups oppose, and underscores a dilemma many states across the country are confronting: how to hold tech firms accountable for their power-hungry data centers and their promises that AI will be powered by green energy. So far, fossil fuels like natural gas and coal plants are expected to meet the demand.\n\"If companies want to build a data center here, and we have to build new power generation for them, then they need to share in that risk,\" Indiana Rep. Ed Soliday, a Republican who authored the bill, told Business Insider. \"There are a couple of data center folks that have said, 'Oh no, that's not fair.' Yes, it is. Grandma down the street shouldn't have to pay for your dreams.\"\nAaron Tinjum, vice president of energy at the Data Center Coalition, a trade group, said in a statement that the industry is committed to paying its full cost of service. He said state utility commissions are best positioned to ensure costs and rates are allocated fairly across all customers.\n\"The data center industry will continue to lean in as a collaborative partner with utilities, grid operators, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders at this transformative moment to advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support economic growth and competitiveness,\" Tinjum said.\nWhile Indiana doesn't top the list of major US data center hubs, the Rust Belt state is emerging as another player for many reasons. Indiana has a reliable power supply from coal and natural gas and can draw electricity from two regional grids. That state has a low risk of natural disasters that could disrupt that supply. Indiana lawmakers in 2019 exempted data center equipment and energy use from sales taxes. Land is also cheaper than other parts of the country.\nThose perks have attracted large data centers to northern Indiana. Last year, Amazon Web Services started construction on an $11 billion data center campus in New Carlisle. Google announced plans to build a $2 billion data center in Fort Wayne. Microsoft is planning a $1 billion data center in LaPorte; Meta is investing $800 million in a campus in southern Indiana that could operate by 2026.\nProjects in the pipeline could consume more electricity than the nearly 7 million residents in Indiana combined by 2035, according to forecasts by state utilities analyzed by the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, an advocacy group that opposes data center development in the state.\nThe coalition has called for a moratorium on new data centers until state leaders can study their potential impact on the electric grid and utility bills. But as more projects enter the pipeline with support from state officials, the coalition last year intervened in negotiations between a utility and the data center industry — including Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft — aimed at ensuring the companies pay a fair share for their energy use and associated power grid infrastructure upgrades. The parties in November reached an agreement aimed at shielding Indiana customers from some of the extra costs by requiring large data centers each month to pay at least 80% of their contracted electricity use, even if they don't use it. New transmission infrastructure and power generation to serve data centers could cost up to $1 billion, the agreement said.\nIndiana regulators approved the settlement in February. The utility, Indiana Michigan Power, initiated the changes to what its big industrial energy users pay after forecasting that data centers could increase peak electricity demand by 150% by 2030, to more than 7,000 megawatts. That's equivalent to power for about 4.6 million residents in the state or two-thirds of Indiana's entire population. And that's just one utility's service area. The Northern Indiana Public Service Company's latest forecast shows data centers could double its energy demand by 2035.\nAndrew Williamson, Indiana Michigan Power's directory of regulatory services, said in written testimony that the magnitude of demand for electricity was unprecedented and unlike any previous energy load additions the utility had ever experienced.\nRather than striking deals utility by utility, consumer advocates said a statewide law could better protect Indiana residents from rising energy bills associated with new data centers.\nBut the bill moving through the state legislature falls short, said Ben Inskeep, program director of the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana. He said the bill contains a loophole, in that it doesn't cover special contracts utilities can negotiate with data centers for electricity rates. The bill also would create an expedited process for approving new power generation by a utility that wants to connect large energy loads like a data center, which Inskeep worried wouldn't allow enough time for public input. The coalition also wants lawmakers to eliminate provisions allowing utilities to seek permission from state regulators to recover up to 100% of the costs of building small nuclear reactors from customers.\n\"We need state policymakers to be thinking about these issues in a comprehensive way,\" Inskeep said. \"But we want to make sure what they do doesn't create more harm than good.\"\nIndiana Gov. Mike Braun told News 10 in February that he supported nuclear power but that utilities should shoulder the costs.\n\"I'm hesitant about putting that solely on the back of the ratepayers,\" Braun said, adding that the utility companies will have to absorb those costs through \"capitalism.\"\n\"They are out there as investor owned, and some of that is going to have to be the risk that they take,\" Braun said.\nThe bill passed the House on February 13 and was referred to a Senate committee. The Indiana legislature is in session through April.\nMeanwhile, the data center boom shows no signs of slowing in Indiana and across the US, including from foreign investors eager to get a stake in the AI race.\nHussain Sajwani, a real estate tycoon dubbed the \"Donald of Dubai,\" has business deals with Trump and Elon Musk. Whether Sajwani's planned $20 billion investment in data centers is getting underway in Indiana is unclear, but for Inskeep, it wasn't surprising.\n\"Oh, here comes another one,\" Inskeep said of his initial reaction. \"At this moment in time, we're just seeing so many data centers flood into Indiana that's a bit overwhelming. And it's really hard to fathom the magnitude of the impacts.\"\nGoogle declined BI's request to comment, Microsoft didn't respond, and Amazon did not send a comment by the time of publication.\nDo you have a story to share?

            "full_content": "Happy almost Friday! If you're indulging in a Thirsty Thursday — Do people still call it that? —don't be surprised if happy hour looks a bit gray. While millennials and Gen Zers are cutting back on booze, the number of boomers tipping one (or a few) back is rising.\nIn today's big story, Microsoft is rethinking how it evaluates employees and handles underperformers.\nMarkets: The jobs report is tomorrow, but don't expect a DOGE-sized drop in numbers. Here's why.\nTech: Meta's got a list of ex-employees it won't rehire.\nBusiness: Lulu Cheng Meservey's brash PR tactics annoy some of her peers, but her big-name clients can't get enough of it.\nBut first, HR is going to join us for this one.\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\nMicrosoft's performance review is on a PIP.\nThe tech giant is rethinking how it evaluates employees, according to Business Insider's Ashley Stewart, who spoke to several people with knowledge of the plans.\nThe result could be Microsoft taking a tougher stance on employees deemed low performers. Evidence of that came earlier this year when Microsoft made hundreds of performance-based cuts in January and February.\nIn many ways, it's a blast from the past for Microsoft, which once had a reputation for conducting tough reviews. The arrival of Satya Nadella as CEO more than a decade ago changed that, with the company taking a softer stance. Some even called Microsoft a \"country club.\"\nMicrosoft's current process for managing out low performers can take months of documentation. One high-level manager told Ashley the average time to exit a low performer after a manager notified HR was about seven months. That process can be further delayed if an employee takes a leave of absence, which can reset the clock.\nBut with the AI race heating up, Microsoft wants to move faster and more efficiently. Like its peers Meta, Amazon, and Google, that's meant taking a deeper look at its performance review and management process.\nMicrosoft's potential pivot also shows where AI's had the most impact thus far.\nSince ChatGPT's arrival a few years ago, there's been plenty of speculation about all the jobs that were at risk of being automated away by AI.\nThe reality, though, is the tech isn't advanced enough to replace most roles completely. Efficiencies can be achieved that allow a company to cut some headcount, but AI hasn't completely wiped out jobs in most cases.\nIn fact, the industry AI is disrupting the most is the one building it: tech.\nIt's not just a matter of AI automating people's jobs. (Although those are looking dicey for software engineers.) The massive bets tech giants are making on AI are forcing them to recalibrate their entire operations to be as streamlined as possible, and those changes don't come easy.\nPerhaps the shift was always coming. The rise of interest rates and the maturation of these companies might have naturally led to a stage of buckling down.\nBut spending billions on tech that hasn't fully panned out from a business perspective certainly didn't slow things down.\n1. Federal workers' layoff pains will be mostly invisible in Friday's jobs report. DOGE's February firings won't be reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report because of the cuts' timing. And even though the job losses will appear in a more distant report, they probably won't make a big dent overall.\n2. Are we on the verge of a \"Trumpcession\"? Wall Street exec Jeffrey Solomon is part of a small but growing group of forecasters using the dreaded R-word: recession. In an interview with CNBC, Solomon said a trade war could impact supply chains and prompt business leaders to pump the brakes on dealmaking. Some signs already point to an economic slowdown, and Solomon isn't alone in waving the red flag.\n3. Brevan Howard is telling investors the \"true risk\" is not getting in on crypto. For years, institutions have kept their distance from digital assets. Brevan Howard's CEO told BI the tipping point for institutional investors is on the horizon, thanks to the boost provided by President Trump and crypto czar David Sacks. The firm, whose digital assets unit was up more than 52% in 2024, wants to be the go-to place for crypto-curious institutions.\n1. Meta keeps \"block\" lists of ex-employees. Hiring managers at Meta sometimes pursue laid-off workers for rehire. They express interest, set up a screening call — and then ghost. That's because some ex-employees are on lists that deem them \"ineligible for rehire,\" even if they have a written track record of exceeding managers' expectations. BI's story elicited a reaction from former Google HR chief Laszlo Bock.\n2. Google Search is going AI Mode. The tech giant said it plans to test a new \"AI Mode\" feature for Search that aims to answer users' queries with \"a wider and more diverse\" set of AI-powered results. Instead of AI Overviews, which respond to queries with a direct answer at the top of the results page, the new AI Mode takes things a step further by generating an entire page.\n3. Big events for big ratings. TV networks have been struggling with maintaining their audiences for years. But BI's Peter Kafka picked up on a pattern to get more eyes: streaming must-watch live sports and awards shows. The most recent Oscars, the Super Bowl, and the Olympics got bumps in viewers, and streaming was part of their equation.\n1. Meet the PR pitbull adored by Sam Altman and Bari Weiss. Lulu Cheng Meservey is one of Silicon Valley's most sought-after communications gurus, known for her unusually aggressive \"going direct\" strategy. Less enchanted are her PR peers, who aren't sold on her style of bucking convention, tweeting madly, and playing offense with the press. Still, Cheng Meservey won the admiration of startup founders by showing them how she thinks.\n2. A new DOGE staffer was connected to a fertility clinic and has ties to the pronatalist movement. Miles Collins, whose association with DOGE was first reported by BI, is a startup founder who employees say has been working at the Department of Labor. Collins was connected to a California fertility clinic that's now facing lawsuits accusing it of mistreating employees, although the company has denied wrongdoing. Collins is also the brother of a prominent pronatalist, a movement that Elon Musk has also spoken in favor of.\n3. A tariff breather for car companies. President Donald Trump is giving the Big Three automakers — Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors — a one-month pause on his recent tariffs to avoid an \"economic disadvantage.\" But there won't be another break when Trump's second round of trade-related tariffs takes effect on April 2, and additional tariffs on steel and aluminum are coming this month.\nThe Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

            "full_content": "It's not easy handing over the reins of the company you created — just ask Bill Gates.\nGates worried about the company's future when he ended his tenure as Microsoft's CEO in 2000, he said in an interview Microsoft posted Thursday.\n\"I've had two successors, and boy, do I feel lucky because as I went off to do the foundation work, the one thing that plagued me was, was I going to see the company fade in terms of its excellence, and would I be haunted by should I go back, should I not go back?\" he said.\nThe billionaire Microsoft cofounder was succeeded as CEO by Steve Ballmer, who led the company from 2000 to 2014.\nGates wrote in his his memoir, \"Source Code,\" which came out last month, that he gave a 4% stake to Ballmer to convince him to quit business school and join Microsoft. Once Ballmer came aboard in 1980, he \"became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,\" Gates wrote.\nBallmer was later succeeded by Satya Nadella, who has held the role since taking over in 2014.\nGates says his fears were unfounded in hindsight since Ballmer \"took us to new heights\" and Nadella has done well at \"navigating what even today remains one of the most complex CEO jobs in the world.\"\nThe company has notched several important milestones since Gates departed as CEO.\nIts market cap has grown substantially, hitting a record $3 trillion dollars late last year. The company released the first Xbox in 2001 and has snapped up video game makers Mojang and Activision Blizzard. It also acquired companies like GitHub and LinkedIn. In recent years, it's poured billions into a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\"It makes me feel so good that I get to just come in and play a very bit role of doing product reviews, learning about AI, you know, getting some help from Microsoft on the work that I'm doing,\" Gates added. \"And it's allowed me, you know, to throw everything in and to have the incredible resources that my Microsoft ownership created.\"\nWhile Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000, he continued to serve on the company's board of directors until 2020, when he stepped down following allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward female employees.\nHe has spent much of his time since on the philanthropic foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.\nBI's Ashley Stewart reported last year that Gates remains \"intimately involved in the company's operations\" behind the scenes, reviewing products, advising on strategy, and recruiting top executives.\nFrank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told BI at the time that Gates' role as a technical advisor, which he began in 2014, hadn't substantially changed since he vacated his board seat.\nThe \"insistence on portraying the role of Bill Gates as 'pulling strings' at Microsoft,\" Shaw told BI at the time, \"is fundamentally inaccurate and at odds with reality.\"\n\"With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company,\" Gates wrote in 2020 about the move. \"Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals.\""

            "full_content": "The \"five things you did last week\" email that DOGE sent to all federal workers has raised an important question for employees everywhere. How do you stay on your boss's radar in a positive way?\nSimply put, if your boss already knew what you were up to, they wouldn't need to send an email like that. As the former VP of HR for Microsoft with 40 years of business leadership experience, I've seen a lot of people who know how to stay visible.\nBeing visible helps avoid uncomfortable inquiries like the \"five bullet points\" request and makes performance reviews easier for both you and your boss. It helps you avoid being labeled an underperformer when cuts are considered and it can help you be more top of mind when opportunities arise — it's a great way to \"manage up.\"\nHere are three ways to help you stay visible to your boss and reduce your chances of being laid off.\nIt doesn't matter if your boss sends an intrusive status report request like \"send five bullet points from last week\" or a simple \"Hey, what's up?\" inquiry; you should always be ready to talk about what you've been up to.\nThat's why you should track your accomplishments. There are many ways to do this. Some people keep a \"brag book,\" a simple document where they list the significant things they've done. Others use a notes application or even a complex database.\nMy spreadsheet had columns labeled: Date, Item, Significance, and Notes. Every day, or at worst, every week, I'd add a couple of rows to the sheet. I'd insert the date and a phrase for the item — just enough to remind me what it was.\nIn the significance column, I'd put a number to represent how important the item felt at the time, with \"5\" being the highest. In notes, I'd add a comment or even a link to the project or document.\nThen whenever I wanted, I could sort by significance and date and get the most important things from the last month, week, or year. When bosses requested a progress report, I was always ready to respond: \"I'm glad you asked.\"\nThe best way to ensure this happens is to make it a habit. Spend two minutes updating your list at the end of every day. This also helps at performance review time, where you'll inevitably need to report on your accomplishments for the year.\nAnother important way to stay visible is to ensure you take credit when you deserve it. Too many people get shy or humble at work and let others grab the limelight.\nWork is not a place for excessive humility. The forever humble, the \"I'm just doing my job\" kind of people are often overlooked. They're just doing their jobs, after all. If you want to be seen, you have to be visible. Don't be afraid to take credit for your accomplishments.\nInsist your name appears on that proposal or presentation. Don't be afraid to put your name under the title of that document. Don't be shy about answering \"That was me\" when someone asks about a great idea.\nAlso, don't let others steal your work without objection — even if you lose a battle for representation. For example, when your boss takes the credit, putting them on notice helps for the next time. If you simply let people take credit for your work, they'll never stop.\nA final way to stay visible is to not shrink into a corner when the boss needs help. When the call comes for volunteers, raise your hand.\nOne of the best ways to stay on your boss's good side is to help them get their job done. The best way to do that is to do things they don't want or have time to do. Just being able to say, \"Don't worry, I'll handle that,\" means a lot.\nBut it's often hard to know what they need help with. You don't do their job, so it's a challenge to understand where you can jump in. When they explicitly ask, that's where you can most certainly be useful.\nYou don't have to raise your hand all the time. You don't have to answer your boss's every whim. You shouldn't stretch yourself beyond your limits just to be in their good graces.\nBut you should also not be the one who never volunteers. Your boss will notice that you never pitch in or lend a hand to your peers. That's how you stay on your boss's radar in the worst possible way.\nEssentially, if you track your performance, take credit where due, and learn when to help out, you'll never be blindsided by the \"five things you did last week\" request because both you and your boss will already know. These are three great ways to increase visibility at work.\nChris Williams is a former VP of HR at Microsoft. He's an executive-level advisor and consultant with over 40 years of experience leading and building teams."

            "full_content": "Amazon Web Services on Thursday debuted its prototype quantum chip, the Ocelot, making headway in the race to develop functional quantum computers.\n\"What makes Ocelot different and special is the way it approaches the fundamental challenge we have with quantum computers, and that is the errors that they're susceptible to,\" Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at AWS told Business Insider.\nAmazon, in research published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, says the Ocelot represents a breakthrough in error correction and scalability — two key issues that have long slowed advancement in the field. The Ocelot prototype demonstrated the potential to increase efficiency in quantum error correction by up to 90% compared to conventional approaches, the company says.\n\"And that efficiency is something on the order of a factor of five to 10x so it's a pretty significant reduction,\" Painter said. \"We still have about a factor of a billion to reduce the error rate — so that it's a huge gap — but it turns out that quantum error correction is up to the challenge, and it turns out that we eventually can bridge this massive gap.\"\nQuantum computing is a growing field of technology that combines computer science, math, and quantum mechanics. It relies on units of information called qubits rather than the binary bits used in classical computing.\nQubits hold more information than binary bits and can exist in multiple states simultaneously. However, they are unstable, difficult to measure, and require specific conditions — such as low light or extremely cold environments — to reliably replicate results without errors, which has slowed progress in the field for years.\nBut when they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits enable quantum computers to solve more complex calculations more quickly than classical computers can. Researchers in the field agree that computations solvable through quantum computing could help discover new drugs, promote sustainable food growth in harsh climates, develop new chemical compounds, or break our current encryption methods, among other outcomes.\nAmazon said the Ocelot chip uses a kind of qubit technology called cat qubits, named after the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. This technology intrinsically suppresses certain forms of errors, simplifying and reducing the quantum error correction required to build a full-fledged quantum computer, a spokesperson said.\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the chip has a unique architecture that integrates the cat qubit technology and additional quantum error correction components into the chip that can be manufactured using processes borrowed from the electronics industry.\nBefore fully-fledged and functional quantum computers can become commercially useful, Painter and other quantum researchers agree they must make more progress in error reduction and scalability. While Amazon's new chip doesn't mean commercially useful quantum computers are in production now, it's the latest in a series of recent advancements in the field that has galvanized the industry and suggests commercial adoption will come sooner than expected.\nRob Schoelkopf, cofounder and chief scientist of Quantum Circuits, said Amazon's research results \"highlight how more efficient error correction is key to ensuring viable quantum computing. \" He described the company's progress as \"a good step toward exploring and preparing for future roadmaps\" in further developing quantum technology.\nAmazon's announcement comes about a week after Microsoft unveiled its quantum chip, the Majorana 1. Microsoft says its chip is powered by a new state of matter and allows for more stable, scalable, and simplified quantum computing.\nSimilarly, Google in December announced its quantum chip, Willow, which the company says can perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes. It's a task that would take the current fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete — a timeframe that exceeds the age of the universe.\n\"We really are at a very exciting time in quantum computing, and you're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point,\" Painter said.\nSankar Das Sarma, a theoretical condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland's Joint Quantum Institute, told Business Insider Amazon's Ocelot chip is a \"more conventional superconducting chip, perhaps similar to the ones developed by Google and IBM,\" than the one recently unveiled by Microsoft — though he added it's too soon to say which company is ahead in their findings.\n\"The MSFT work is based on topological Majorana zero modes, which also has a superconductor, but in a radically different manner,\" Das Sarma wrote in an email to BI. \"In particular, the MSFT device, if it works correctly, is protected topologically with minimal need for error correction, whereas the AWS claim seems to be that they have made some improvement in the conventional error correction schemes. The two approaches are very different.\"\nResearchers in the field are closely monitoring Amazon's and other companies' advancements, hoping to prove that quantum technology will become commercially viable sooner than anticipated. In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggested we were still 20 years away from the technology being \"very useful,\" sending quantum stocks tumbling.\nTroy Nelson, the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that each company's announcement represents another building block that the industry will use along the way to a functioning quantum computer.\n\"There's lots of challenges ahead. What Amazon gained in error correction — and it has led to some new scientific knowledge and discoveries in error correction — was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip,\" Nelson said. \"We're still in prototype days, and we still have multiple years to go, but they've made a great leap forward.\""

El gigante tecnológico ha dado un paso en su estrategia para reducir la dependencia de los creadores de ChatGPT y tiene planes de venderlos a terceros. Pese a haber invertido miles de millones de dólares en OpenAI, Microsoft no quiere estar supeditado a los avances de esa empresa.\nDe acuerdo con The Information, Microsoft está desarrollando una nueva familia de modelos de lenguaje conocida como MAI. Según las fuentes, estos modelos podrían hacer frente a los más poderosos de OpenAI y Anthropic. Uno de ellos tiene capacidades de razonamiento similares a las de O1 y Claude Sonnet 3.7.\nEl reporte señala que esta iniciativa es comandada por Mustafá Sulaymán, responsable de la división de inteligencia artificial de Microsoft. Sulaymán no solo busca reducir la dependencia de OpenAI, sino que también analiza la posibilidad de integrar modelos de otras empresas a Copilot. Sumado al desarrollo de MAI, los ingenieros de Microsoft ya comenzaron a probar los modelos de DeepSeek, Meta y xAI como un reemplazo potencial de OpenAI en su chatbot.\nLos detalles son escasos y la información no ha sido confirmada por OpenAI o Microsoft. No obstante, la decisión de alejarse de OpenAI tiene sentido después de que la relación entre ambas compañías se debilitara en los últimos meses. Algunos rumores sugieren que OpenAI quiere deshacerse de Microsoft y ya tiene un plan para lograrlo.\nUn reporte del New York Times publicado en octubre de 2024 afirmaba que OpenAI no está satisfecha con la alianza que forjó con Microsoft. La empresa dirigida por Sam Altman reclamó que en Redmond no les brindaban el poder de cómputo suficiente para avanzar en el desarrollo de su IA. Esta es una parte fundamental del acuerdo entre ambas empresas, aunque también existe un motivo adicional para el descontento.\nSegún las fuentes, OpenAI también se molestó porque Microsoft contrató a Mustafá Sulaymán, cofundador de DeepMind, para dirigir su división de IA. Sulaymán, una figura polémica en la industria, supuestamente tuvo un altercado con un empleado de OpenAI durante una videollamada. Además, empleados de Microsoft descargaron software propietario de OpenAI sin pedir autorización, lo que tensó más la relación entre ambas empresas.\nUna filtración adicional reveló que OpenAI está presionando a Microsoft para romper el contrato de exclusividad que les exige usar Azure. De este modo, el equipo de Sam Altman tendría acceso a más poder de cómputo para impulsar el desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial general (AGI). Microsoft sabe que esto pondría en riesgo aún más su inversión, puesto que OpenAI no estaría obligada a compartir sus tecnologías si consigue alcanzar la AGI.\nCualquiera que sea el desenlace de esta situación, lo cierto es que Microsoft ha pisado el acelerador para impulsar el desarrollo de sus propios modelos. La llegada de DeepSeek y su modelo asequible también podría influir en la reducción de la dependencia de OpenAI en Copilot."

La nueva alternativa no requiere una suscripción a Microsoft 365 y permite descargar e instalar algunas aplicaciones de la suite ofimática en tu ordenador. La única diferencia es que estas aplicaciones incluyen anuncios y omiten algunas funciones de la versión de pago.\nDe acuerdo con Beebom, Microsoft ha lanzado una versión gratuita de Office con anuncios. Esta membresía permite utilizar Word, Excel y PowerPoint sin necesidad de pagar una cuota mensual. El único requisito es iniciar sesión con tu cuenta de Microsoft y soportar los anuncios que aparecen en el panel lateral.\nSi bien Office es gratuito en la web, para usar las aplicaciones en un ordenador es necesario contar con una membresía activa de Microsoft 365. Al parecer ese requerimiento se ha suavizado en los últimos días con una suscripción gratuita. Microsoft ofrece las tres apps más populares de la suite ofimática, aunque con funcionamiento limitado y un banner lateral con publicidad en la interfaz de usuario.\nTras instalarlas, el usuario visualizará una pantalla en la que se ofrece la opción de utilizar Word, Excel y PowerPoint gratis a cambio de anuncios. Microsoft también preguntará si quieres visualizar ofertas personalizadas basadas en tu actividad dentro de la app. Este paso es completamente opcional, por lo que es posible evitar el seguimiento.\nLa versión gratuita de Office con anuncios está muy limitada debido a que no ofrece acceso a capacidades básicas. Por ejemplo, en Word no es posible cambiar el interlineado, insertar tablas, imágenes, gráficos u otro contenido multimedia. Tampoco puedes añadir portadas, encabezado o pie de página, alterar el estilo (fuentes, colores, temas) y tal vez lo peor: la función de WordArt está desactivada.\nEl bloqueo de funciones es diferente en cada app. Por ejemplo, en PowerPoint es posible añadir tablas, imágenes, cuadros de texto y WordArt, puesto que son elementos básicos para una presentación. Por otro lado, Excel admite tablas, fórmulas y gráficos, aunque no permite acceder a las funciones de datos o las tablas dinámicas.\nOtra limitante que encontramos en la versión gratuita de Office con anuncios es que solo permite guardar tus archivos en OneDrive. Si quieres hacerlo en tu disco duro o pendrive, tendrás que descargarlo desde la nube o acceder a tu carpeta sincronizada del ordenador.\nA primera vista, la versión de Office con anuncios no ofrece nada nuevo si lo comparamos con las versiones web de Word, Excel y PowerPoint. Si no te interesa pagar una mensualidad, la opción más recomendada es acceder a la web de Office y usar las aplicaciones ahí. Otra alternativa es comprar una llave de Office 2021 por unos cuantos euros (o pesos) e instalar las aplicaciones de forma legal y sin restricciones."

            "full_content": "An ongoing phishing campaign disguised as a Booking.com email casts keystroke and credential-stealing malware into hospitality employees' inboxes for financial fraud and theft, according to Microsoft Threat Intelligence.\nRedmond says the email attacks began in December, and were still happening as of February. The threat intel team attributes the campaign to a group it tracks as Storm-1865, which in 2023 used a similar Booking.com themed-lure and social engineering techniques to target hotel guests, and last year targeted e-commerce platform buyers.\n\"These campaigns have been ongoing with increased volume since at least early 2023 and involve messages sent through vendor platforms, such as online travel agencies and e-commerce platforms, and email services, such as Gmail or iCloud Mail,\" according to a Thursday report that, oddly enough, doesn't name-drop Exchange or other Microsoft email services.\nThe latest credential-stealing attempts specifically target hospitality employees that likely work with Booking.com in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and across the continent of Europe. \nWhile all of the emails impersonate the online travel agency, their content varies and they sometimes mention negative hotel guest reviews or requests from prospective travelers, or online promotion opportunities and account verification – anything to prompt a gut-reaction click from the perons opening the email before they get a chance to consider the message's origins.\nThese emails include a link or PDF attachment with a link in the document, and you can probably guess what happens next. The link claims to take whoever clicks on it to Booking.com, but instead leads to an attacker-controlled website with a fake CAPTCHA puzzle.\nThe phony CAPTCHA uses the ClickFix social engineering technique. This is where an attacker displays a fake error message instructing the user to fix the issue by copying and pasting a command that ultimately downloads malware to the victim's device. This type of user interaction means the malicious code is more likely to bypass built-in security features.\nIn this particular phishing campaign, the attackers prompt the user to use a keyboard shortcut and open Windows Run, and then paste a command that downloads and launches malware:\nThis campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT. Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.\nAll of these payloads can steal credentials and financial data, which Microsoft says is one of Storm-1865's trademarks. \"Storm\" is how Microsoft tracks groups that are still in development (along the line of how Russian groups all have \"Blizzard\" in their name and Chinese groups are \"Typhoons\").\nStorm-1865, we're told, includes a cluster of phishing attacks leading to financial fraud.\nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to answer The Register's questions including the geographic region where Storm-1865 attacks originate and whether its activity overlaps with any other threat groups that Redmond is tracking.\nThe spokesperson also declined to tell us how many organizations have been affected by this latest Booking.com phishing campaign. ®\nThe Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n                        Copyright.

That's up three percentage points from the previous survey six months prior, a Microsoft spokesperson said.\nLast summer, responses to this question had fallen from 69% to 62% compared to the previous year, according to results viewed by Business Insider.\nMicrosoft uses this specific question as an important barometer for sentiment about work-life balance and compensation.\nIn 2022, a low and declining score on this question helped compel Microsoft to raise pay to address growing dissatisfaction with compensation and stop employees from leaving to competitors like Amazon.\nSince then, the tech industry has undergone radical changes. Tech stocks plummeted through 2022 as the pandemic boom ended. That prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs. New AI tools may also be denting demand for some tech workers. In 2023, Microsoft froze salaries.\nThe next survey, scheduled in April, comes after Microsoft cut nearly 2,000 employees deemed low performers.\nThe company is also revamping its performance review process, another sign that the industry is getting tougher on how it treats employees after a decade or more of mollycoddling talent.\nHave a tip?

            "full_content": "Microsoft’s big Xbox hit, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, debuts on Sony’s PlayStation 5 on April 17.\nIt’s part of Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer’s strategy to take “Xbox everywhere” and debut even the biggest exclusives on the Xbox platform on other platforms. This has been controversial for gamers who wonder why they ever bought Xbox hardware, but that’s part of the trade-off. There have been endless debates on social media about how Microsoft should keep the crown jewels like its Indiana Jones game as a reward for its loyal Xbox fans. It so happens that Indiana Jones was my favorite game of 2024.\nBut Sony has a much larger audience of PlayStation fans who are willing to pay Microsoft to play the game. Plus, Microsoft has already had a six-month window of exclusivity for Xbox/Windows.\nSince Sony has a larger installed based and a dedicated crop of hardcore gamers, this kind of game from Microsoft’s Bethesda studio could do even better on the PS5 than it did on the Xbox Series X/S. And that helps Microsoft reinvest its profits in bigger and better games for Xbox in the future.\nMicrosoft has a collector’s edition with cool stuff and will include Indiana Jones downloadable content, dubbed The Order of Giants, for the Sony edition. I like this game a lot, as it was my favorite game of 2024.\nI liked the hilarious trailer with Troy Baker, who voiced Indiana Jones for the game, and Nolan North, who voiced Sony’s signature adventure game Uncharted with the lead character Nathan Drake. Baker and North banter about joining forces.\nNorth represents the best of action-adventure gaming on the PlayStation, while Baker and the Indiana Jones game have set a new bar for the genre on the Xbox. \nStay in the know!

            "full_content": "Tecnología, ciencia y cultura digital\t\t\t\t\nMicrosoft se prepara para integrar la IA de Copilot en el ecosistema de Xbox. A unos meses de presentar las primeras demos con Minecraft, el gigante tecnológico está listo para dar el siguiente paso y anunció que extenderá la funcionalidad de la IA a los videojuegos. Copilot debutará en la app de Xbox para móviles, con miras a integrarse en las consolas a futuro.\nLa compañía llevó a cabo una presentación a través de su canal de YouTube en la cual detalló cómo la IA funcionará en los juegos de Xbox. Copilot for Gaming funciona como un asistente virtual, ofreciendo funciones como instalación de juegos, seguimiento de tu historial o recomendaciones personalizadas. Los usuarios pueden utilizar la app de Xbox para chatear con Copilot y hacerle preguntas en tiempo real, como si fuera ChatGPT.\nUna de las características más llamativas es la función de Copilot como asistente de juegos. Esta función apoya a los jugadores buscando soluciones para avanzar en un juego, como derrotar a jefes o resolver puzzles, a través de las funciones de búsqueda en línea de Bing. El asistente de juegos estará disponible a través de la app de Xbox, lo que permitirá a los usuarios acceder a guías de juegos, wikis y foros de la comunidad.\nMicrosoft mencionó que está colaborando con los estudios de videojuegos para garantizar que el contenido publicado por Copilot se ajuste a la visión de los desarrolladores. La IA también incluirá la atribución a las fuentes originales, manteniendo la transparencia y la credibilidad. La tecnológica reveló que existen planes para ampliar las colaboraciones más allá de los estudios propios, lo que sugiere una mayor integración en la biblioteca de juegos de Xbox.\nDesde el anuncio en mayo de 2024, Microsoft dejó claras sus intenciones de integrar Copilot en Xbox como un asistente personal. La demo de Minecraft presentada en su momento mostraba a una IA que colaboraba con los jugadores para ayudarlos a avanzar en el juego. Si bien algunos consideran que Copilot va en contra de los principios de un videojuego, lo cierto es que muchos buscan ayuda en Google.\nFátima Kardar, vicepresidenta de Gaming AI en Microsoft, mencionó que buscan ayudar a que los jugadores nuevos no se sientan intimidados y abandonen el juego. \"Probé otros [después de Stardew Valley] y los dejé muy rápido porque pensé que no llegaba a ninguna parte. Entonces realmente ayuda cuando estás estancado o indefenso, es algo que he visto mucho\".\nAdemás de las funcionalidades existentes, Microsoft está explorando posibles aplicaciones que podrían ampliar la utilidad de Copilot. Estas incluyen recomendaciones de estrategia en tiempo real durante partidas competitivas, seguimiento de la ubicación de objetos y explicaciones contextuales de los eventos del juego.\nA pesar del ambicioso alcance, el lanzamiento inicial de Copilot for Gaming es relativamente limitado. Las primeras versiones se apoyarán en la aplicación móvil de Xbox, en lugar de en una integración completa en el juego. Microsoft planea iterar en función de los comentarios de los usuarios, ampliando el conjunto de funciones y compatibilidad con otros dispositivos.\nAquellos interesados podrán acceder a él a través del programa Xbox Insiders en la app móvil de Xbox."

            "full_content": "Is Sam Wilson a next-level genius when it comes to choosing his phone?\n  \nAnthony Mackie stars as Sam Wilson (aka Captain America) in Captain America: Brave New World.\nI saw Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World, and was all-in on Harrison Ford's Red Hulk (including the monster's chest hair). However, I'll save my thoughts on how good, or how tedious, the film was for later. But there was one moment that made me chuckle, and then made me think. Don't worry -- this doesn't spoil anything.\nAt one point in the movie Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, pulls out his phone to show another character some information (see, no spoils). Captain America's phone of choice? A Microsoft Surface Duo.\nAt first I thought this was an odd choice. Sam seems to have all the superhero tech he could want, aside from Super Soldier Serum (which is in part what makes him so wonderful as Captain America). He's got Wakanda-ified wings, cool flight googles, Redwing and… a Surface Duo phone. Three of the four of these make perfect sense for Captain America.\nNothing like a little motion blur: here's Sam holding his Microsoft Surface Duo.\nAs a phone reviewer for CNET, a Surface Duo cameo was an unexpected delight. I let out a small laugh when I saw it, and judging by the silence in the theater, I'd say no one else enjoyed the mobile phone Easter egg. But was this clever product placement or a prop guy who gave Mackie a cool phone worthy of an Avenger? Or perhaps...was the Duo's appearance something else?\nThe Surface Duo isn't the first niche phone to get screen time. The Red Hydrogen One phone ended up on Dominic Toretto's dashboard in F9 and Leonard DiCaprio used the same phone in Don't Look Up, although neither Leo nor Vin Diesel took advantage of the phone's 3D lenticular screen. So an out-of-place phone in a movie or TV show isn't entirely unexpected for me.\nBut Sam's phone isn't a Hydrogen One, it's a Microsoft Surface Duo that came in 2020 and didn't sell well. A second version, the Surface Duo 2, came out in 2021, also didn't sell well and subsequently became the last version. It was hard to tell which model Sam had – I was looking for the Duo 2's Glance Bar, but there wasn't a good shot of the phone closed. (Sam would totally use the Glance Bar.)\nThe Surface Duo is comprised of two 5.6-inch screens connected by a pair of stainless steel hinges (one at the top, one at the bottom). It's genuinely one of the most striking phones ever made. All of this leads to the question: Why does Captain America have a Surface Duo?\nThis is the part that I couldn't stop thinking about. There is a fictional galaxy where Sam bought the phone in 2020, and because he is such a meticulous technician when it comes to taking care of his gear, he's just kept it in perfect condition for five years (or seven years, remember Captain America: Brave New World is set in 2027). Though he'd definitely had to swap out the battery at some point.\nThen there's another scenario where Sam read about how amazing the Surface Duo's hardware was (despite some major software issues) and bought it just for Microsoft's brilliant folio design. And just like the way he tinkers around with his EXO-7 Falcon jetpack, I can envision Sam hacking and uploading his own software to run on the Duo and using it ever since.\nOr this just Sam using the Duo as a burner phone? If that's the case, this would be a big flex when it comes to burner phones in TV and movies.\nI go back to the Red Hydrogen One example, as this might really tell us why the Duo is in a Captain America movie. Years ago I interviewed Adam McKay, the director behind Don't Look Out, The Big Short and Anchorman. He explained to me that the discontinued Hydrogen One was in Don't Look Out because a prop guy recommended it. McKay wanted a unique phone and that didn't look like a standard phone onscreen.\n\"And then he [the prop guy] comes back with that phone. He goes, 'This is a whole cellphone that Red cam made. They never released it. Check it out,'\" explained McKay. \"And I started playing with it. I was like, 'Why didn't they release this? This is incredible.' But apparently it's technically a little difficult and not consumer-friendly.\"\nSo why does Captain America have a Surface Duo? We may never know. All of this to say, the movie could have been better."

            "full_content": "The Copilot Voice and Think Deeper AI features for verbal conversations and more complicated queries are now unlimited under its free tier.\n  \nIf you're a Copilot user, you now have more artificial intelligence tools at your fingertips: Microsoft is giving unlimited free access to Voice and Think Deeper on its free tier. Voice lets you have a conversation with the AI tool using verbal commands, while Think Deeper allows for more complex questions than regular Copilot, as it has more advanced reasoning powered by OpenAI's o1 model.\nCopilot, launched in 2022, is Microsoft's entry into the increasingly competitive world of AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. As tech companies compete against each other and new Chinese entrant DeepSeek for a foothold, they continue releasing new AI-powered features and tools -- and are now providing more for free after DeepSeek launched an entirely free service. These Voice and Think Deeper features are variations on the interface, giving users different ways to engage with Microsoft's AI offerings.\nCNET Senior Editor and computing expert Lori Grunin tested out Think Deeper on Tuesday, confirming that while it's free, \"at one point, it stopped providing new answers to refined queries and a 'Get the full Copilot experience' popup and tried to get me to sign in.\"\nGrunin added that it didn't obey specific parameters during her test, either.\nI gave Voice a go without signing into a Copilot account, and it greeted me like a voice assistant, letting me know I can chat to it \"just like with a mate\" (it had a male, British accent, though it noted I could change how it sounded in the settings) and asking me my name. \nIts follow-up question, after mispronouncing my name, was the ever-generic: \"What's on your mind?\" I asked it the weather in my city, and it gave me up-to-date information as well as a recommendation to get \"out and about\" in the unseasonably sunny, warm weather.\nBut it then told me I only had 2 minutes remaining of Voice time. So you really do have to create an account and sign in to get that unlimited access announced today. (When I closed the voice chat, Copilot gave me a transcript of our call.)\nYou can become a Copilot user for free -- just sign up using a Microsoft email address. The free version limits what features you have access to, slows down your responses after 15 \"boosts\" per day and only gives you access to the latest models during non-peak times. There's a paid tier called Copilot Pro ($20/month) and an enterprise version that starts at $30 per user per month.\nSome of Microsoft's suggestions include using Voice for practicing a new language, asking it to help you practice for a job interview and asking it out loud for cooking advice or recipe steps while your hands are busy in the kitchen -- kind of like a voice assistant.\nFor Think Deeper, Microsoft says some of the more complex issues it can help you with are comparing electric vehicles, asking it for home renovation advice and checking for the pros and cons of buying a generator for outages.\nAs with all AI tools, you should be wary of what it advises you to do, however, and CNET recommends double checking everything it comes back with -- whether it's on-the-fly cooking advice that may lead you astray thanks to a hallucination or coming up with a savings plan that makes no financial sense. \nYou also should never tell an AI chatbot any of your personal details, including financial information, lest a data breach leak it to malefactors. \nThat said, our CNET review found Copilot to be one of the better AI tools, giving it a 7 out of 10 as it generally provides accurate and relevant information. Senior CNET writer Imad Khan recommends Anthropic's Claude as the best AI chatbot, however, saying it \"does a consistent job and goes further than what's coming out of Google, Microsoft, Perplexity and OpenAI at the free tier.\""

Having their own server as the coordinating node isn't a bad idea for security, of course.\nIt's a also a great idea if you view customers as data monkeys you can spy on for advertising/ai/whatever.\nThe skype protocol was a thing before standards like ICE, STUN and TURN. Yes, Teams does modern things that are now standardized.\nWhen you need something like a directory service you have to ask yourself if you trust the service. Do you trust the protocol to run safely as the directory service on some user's computer? Do you trust Microsoft to run the directory service?\nI understand Microsoft's position and reasons for centralizing but I don't trust Microsoft.\nThe long game? WHAT long game?\nM$ bought Skype for $hitloads a while back. At that time, they had a few scattered operations some of which they were unsuccessfully trying to push and for business users the execrable Lync. I remember everyone suffering under that awful piece of software commenting that no wonder they bought skype hopefully they'll make Lync like skype.\nWell careful what you wish for I suppose. That's exactly what happened: they made skype a complete piece of garbage and then cancelled it.\nAnd remember they bought Skype from eBay of all places that basically sat on doing nothing.\nEmbrace, Extend, Extinguish.\nWell yes, but that's all done in support of their products. Skype IS their product. This just seems like mismanagement, enshittifying Skype to push teams, a product hated by it's users.\nWhat's the end game? If it's for everyone to use Microsoft products, I didn't see how killing Skype will aid that. If anything it will bolster the competition: not every Skype user will stay on Microsoft products.\nThey bought it for the customer base and the intellectual property, namely the SILK audio codec and its patents.SILK has been been evolved into the Satin audio codec which has been used in Microsoft Teams (and Skype) for quite some time now.\nI guess Microsoft just wants to get rid of Skype's traditional POTS telephony support.  That's a shame.\n It was a long road to killing skype completely but Microsoft plays the long game.So it was the long game of MS to buy something for $8.5B to kill it? What did MS get for their money? Not much as far as I can see. Right after MS bought it, they started changing it. From what I remember, updates removed features and introduced bugginess.

I didn't know that.\nDon't worry, I have WeChat for China.\nHow is whatsapp a replacement for \"Skype out\"?\nif the other end is on whatsapp the call is free.if they aren't you can invite them to whatsapp.if they don't want to get whatsapp you may still dial the number directly but data charges may apply.\nThe only thing left from Skype is the name, and the stupid cartoony sounds it makes all the damn time.\nEverything else has turned into a Slack clone.\nThe US government paid Microsoft to buy and backdoor Skype. The peer to peer nature of old Skype was a threat to US government surveillance.\nThey also bought Groove [wikipedia.org] and did the same to the decentralized platform. Can't have people retain control of their own lives, you know.\nBut that's a very deep cut.\nBut one has to say that with the end of the dial-up era P2P died a bit. Services are centralized because computers are behind a NAT and correct port forwarding isn't easy for most users and uPnP causes chaos. Sadly routers also firewall IPv6 addresses by default, so that you still need to configure your router before doing P2P again.\nBesides becoming popular, the original skype was also decentralized and tried hard to make connections point-to-point rather than need to be proxied. Microsoft bought skype and centralized it a long time ago. Now there is nothing left. It was a long road to killing skype completely but Microsoft plays the long game.\nThe problem was when Microsoft acquired Skype, Microsoft then got sued by patent trolls because that p2p method of connecting to the network was patented. When Skype was a small network barely ma \nI gave up on Skype around ~2005 to roll my own VOIP PBX and I never looked back since. Much more flexible that way anyway.\nWhat happened is that Microsoft bought it.  They didn't know what to do with it but they didn't want anyone else figuring it out.  If Skype was still independent, though, they might have died out.  Except Microsoft bought it from eBay and a private equity firm - I don't even know why eBay wanted it.  Private equity doesn't always give a path to product success if you don't know how to monetize it yet.\nIn early COVID, Zoom was the better product.  I think they had the better 3+ party video call.  Microsoft made a mess of Teams (desktop client running on badly optimized JavaScript ((Electron)), later WebView).  And Google Meet was probably fine but who can keep track of their product of the week?\nZoom let you just start using it without any salespeople.  And free for basic uses, especially personal use where people can learn it on their own.  Both Teams and Google kind of require you to buy into the ecosystem before you can do anything.\nOh come on.  Video calls were commonplace way before Zoom.  Everybody facetimed unless they were poor and used Android.\nSkype was awesome in the early 2000s. There was nothing like it. I could have and should have dominated the mobile and internet messaging industry, especially with the backing of Microsoft.\nBut instead, MS bought it up so that it would stop competing with MSN Messenger. They starved it.\nI hope they don't do the same thing to GroupMe -which is still awesome despite MS.\nEmbrace, extend, extinguish - Microsofts de facto corporate motto.\nThey've tried to do the same to Linux but didn't understand the open source model so have failed despite their best efforts of trying to tie it and its users to windows with WSL.\nBack in 2007+ I was working a lot with colleagues in Shanghai.  Skype was the only thing that could reliably navigate the Great Firewall with its random behaviour as well as providing the only decent and cost effective tool for calling out of China to real phones back home.  It was such an amazing, ground-breaking tool when it came out and cut my work phone usage immensely.\nAfter Microsoft's changes to route everything through its servers, Skype failed a lot more with poor networks.  They ruined the experien \nI'm also in China, and Skype is still very useful for doing stuff \"as if\" I was back home. I use it to do all sort of things and they usually have no idea I'm not in the UK.\nI use it to call friends who can only manage the old fashioned telephone (Skype-to-phone, with a pay-as-you-go balance). It seems Teams can do this, but you need an add-on, so it isn't clear if you can do this with the free version, like with Skype, or, if you can, how.\nI use it to take advantage of free customer support (0800) numbers in \nSounds somewhat like my experience, although that ended in 2014 when the parent company closed our offices in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and then shortly after divested us.  Iâ(TM)ve been to China once since the instead of 4+ times per year and no longer do much with American colleagues, and the ones I do use Teams and Slack (no need to call US toll free numbers).  It looks like the phone options after Skype will be diminished.  This thread and the one Emily links to in her answer seem to sum it up: https:  [microsoft.com]\nI also meant to say that the reality is, is that their user base has shrunk and the people using it for interacting with POTS and mobile phones must be a tiny number.  Calling costs have really shrunk and much of the world outside N. America increasingly uses WhatsApp.  Dunno about China, maybe WeChat?  My WeChat account got deactivated and itâ(TM)s basically impossible to reactivate or signup fresh from here.  Probably donâ(TM)t want an app rooted by the Chinese government on my phone anyway ;)\n268 MB now - which is insane for what it does (and it is using the WebView 2 external component).\nSo what works well for calling land lines, call centers, and cell phones in the US these days? Skype sometimes just doesn't work, so it's good to have a push to find an alternative.\nThis is also my question. I am one of the remaining paid Skype users.  Itâ(TM)s great for receiving and making calls to US numbers overseas.  Iâ(TM)m open to VoIP number suggestions.\nGoogle Voice still exists and can do all those things.\n Google Voice is not available to retail customers outside the USA.\nGoogle is useless if you want worldwide coverage because they deliberately don't serve ~20% of the world population.One should never choose Google anything, imo, if you have any vision of a worldwide target audience.\nPerhaps the biggest reason why Skype and ICQ both fell into irrelevance is that all the other major instant messengers switched to registering with your phone number and nothing else. People got too lazy to bother signing up properly and remembering passwords, but I will miss Skype dearly as it was the only IM that allowed you to find and talk to complete strangers. And I've used it a lot for international calls. I have never seen anything as cheap and efficient as Skype.\nAnd don't get me started on the fact that Skype on Android, the most popular mobile platform, is absolute crap. It's a horrendously slow application where everything takes seconds to complete and it has major issues with notifications. You can actually see how the UI is being rendered on Android in real time, it's almost a slide show. Nothing that I've ever used on PC or mobile was this slow. That's inexcusable for an IM. Oh, and good luck scrolling back through chat histories. I just tried it today. Spent 20 minutes downloading a complete conversation with my friend. Constant \"Loading...\" No search function either.\nMicrosoft never embraced instant passwordless registration and never bothered to rewrite Skype using native interfaces for each mobile operating system. They basically let it rot and die. An $8.5 billion write-off, not counting all the money spent after the acquisition.\nAn extremely sad story indeed.\n An $8.5 billion write-off, not counting all the money spent after the acquisition. Not really. Skype for Business is what they started with when they made Teams.\n An $8.5 billion write-off, not counting all the money spent after the acquisition.\n Not really. Skype for Business is what they started with when they made Teams.\nSkype for Business was unrelated to Skype.  It was the former Microsoft Lync/Office Communicator.  They renamed it because of Skype's brand recognition or something.  Teams wasn't based on Skype for Business, either.  It was a new \"cloud-based\" product designed to replace the hosted version of Skype for Business.  The on-premises Skype for Business server is still available with subscription licensing.\nBut that aside, was it really a waste of $8.5B?  How much money have they made from it between acquiring it \nIt turned into a protective maneuver against Slack and Zoom encroaching on Office.\nBusinesses want Office.  Businesses will always look at the \"included\" thing they already have usage rights to before paying another service provider.  Bundling Teams with Office means deeper entrenchment for Office.\nThat's what they got for $8.5B.  And I'm sure they've already seen the ROI.\nThe first big Skype exodus I saw was to Facebook. In elementary we all had Skype, in hs everyone was on Facebook and coordination happened in Facebook groups. Meanwhile MS changed Skype to only hold the last 6 months of chat history (imagine FB Groups working like that).\nPerhaps the biggest reason why Skype and ICQ both fell into irrelevance is that all the other major instant messengers switched to registering with your phone number and nothing else. People got too lazy to bother signing up properly and remembering passwords, but I will miss Skype dearly as it was the only IM that allowed you to find and talk to complete strangers.I don't think that was it. It certainly didn't help, don't get me wrong, but I don't think that the phone number method was the sole, or even primary, reason for this.I think that most of the IM services of the 90's had trouble making the transition to the mobile space. I'm hard-pressed to think of even one that managed to make the transition. Most surprising to me was AIM; they had mobile apps before smartphones were a thing - it was possible to use AIM on a Motorola Razr, and Cingular (later AT&T) eve \nPerhaps the biggest reason why Skype and ICQ both fell into irrelevance is that all the other major instant messengers switched to registering with your phone number and nothing else.

I'm in Norway. Are there any alternatives?\nYeah, me too. It is also useful for calling free-phone numbers (0800 in the UK) in other countries.What's the alternative now? Especially on Ubuntu?\nOne thing I relied on Skype to do was support calls to US toll-free (800) numbers from abroad.  That saved my patootie a number of times.  Will need to find another means to do the same thing, now.\nAnyone have suggestions?\nJust as they always used to, they bought a cheaper better would-be competitor before it could rise to actually be competitive and then killed it. Nothing new of different in this. After the anti-trust fights they got into years ago, however they have seemingly learned to do it better. This time, they bought the upstart, and let it operate for years as a new and improved Microsoft provided thing before whacking it. Long enough for government regulators and congress critters to not notice and not care. Plus, \nEvery year for years, I get a message from skype saying my balance has expired (ha, what a concept) and I need to re-activate it.  I used it maybe 20 years ago when skype was the best way to make overseas calls.  It's not much, maybe $20.  But they've had and the interest it made them for nearly 15 years.  The honest thing to do would be to return the money to me.  But no.  Just transfer it to teams for one year after which they take it outright.\nYeah, they will still owe me $7.33 in Skype credit for sending SMS text messages and calling POTS phones.\nI used to use it a lot too, to call my elderly mother who can only manage a real POTS phone.Ironically (?) she moved to somewhere that doesn't have any POTS and was forced onto WhatsApp to talk to me, which is very stressful for her because it's very complicated, and so now I can't use my desktop to call her...and now *she* has been using Skype-oit to call her friends where she used to live who also are too elderly to grok phones/etc so she called their POTS phone. Not any more...she's going to be very lone \nOn reflection, after reading some comments and M$ web pages that Teams DOES have the features I want, I had a quick look.\nIt looks like Skype-to-phone, which allows me to call a regular phone number, is a feature, but it isn't shown in the UI, and it seems you need to pay for a service before the button appears. In Skype, you can have a pay-as-you-go balance, which I have, and it \"just doesn't work\"(tm) if your balance is too low; but not so in Teams. The web pages about this all seem to be oriented towards \nSeveral comments mention that Skype's ability to make landline and mobile phone calls will be missed. Those affected may consider using  Viber [viber.com], \"a VoIP and IM application owned by Japanese multinational company Rakuten, provided as freeware for the Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux platforms\" [wikipedia.org]. It does require a mobile phone number to sign up but also provides a desktop application [viber.com], so in that sense it is similar to WhatsApp.\n [Actually, it seems possible to install it on an Android instance on a\nThere may be more comments in this discussion.

The gaming-focused voice and chat app announced that a mobile pilot for Video Quests — ads that allow Discord users to earn rewards like avatar decorations and in-game items by watching a video — will launch in June 2025, after rolling out on PC and consoles last year.\n”Expanding our advertising platform to mobile is an obvious, natural evolution in our strategy,” said Discord’s product leader, Peter Sellis. “Our mission is to create the most authentic, player-centric advertising platform in the galaxy. This expansion will provide brand partners access to Discord’s highly engaged, cross-platform mobile audience — and create new opportunities for businesses to connect with our community in meaningful, and performant, ways.”\nThe new mobile ads don’t seem particularly intrusive — they will appear as a “Quest bar” at the bottom of the screen, which can be dismissed or tapped on to open the dedicated Quest tab. The full-screen videos will only then play if a user chooses to accept the Quest.\nDiscord already allows users on other platforms to hide in-app promotions for specific Quests, or opt out of personalized promotions. These options will also be available for mobile users.\nVideo Quests are one of two Quest formats that Discord launched last year, the other being Play Quests, which reward players for completing in-game tasks. Discord had gained a reputation for being an ad-free platform prior to introducing Quests, having instead relied on user subscriptions to bring in revenue. Mobile Quest ads were already being tested in a limited beta, but this rollout suggests they will now start appearing more broadly.\nThe announcement of mobile ads comes amid rumors that Discord is preparing to launch an initial public offering. The company was last valued at roughly $15 billion by private investors in 2021, and had reportedly discussed a $10 billion acquisition deal with Microsoft that same year that ultimately didn’t materialize anything.\nUpdate, March 20th: added confirmation about ad settings for mobile users.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, upped his investigations into Big Tech by sending subpoenas to 16 major tech companies, asking whether the federal government had pressured them into using artificial intelligence to “censor lawful speech” – a new front in his long-running quest to prove the tech industry is out to silence conservatives.\nIn letters accompanying the subpoenas, Jordan asked the companies – Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic PBC, Apple, Cohere, International Business Machines Corp., Inflection AI, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Open AI, Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, Scale AI, and Stability AI – to preserve all documents between them and the Biden-Harris administration that showed “how and to what extent the executive branch coerced or colluded with artificial intelligence (AI) companies and other intermediaries to censor lawful speech.” The core of their claim: algorithms could be used to discriminate against right wingers not just online, but in any everyday use case for AI, from hiring practices to generative content. \nCiting a report filed last December, in which the committee found several alleged examples of Biden officials “pressuring private companies to ‘advance equity,’ stop ‘algorithmic discrimination,’ and ‘mitigate the production of harmful and biased outputs,’” Jordan demanded they produce any and all emails with a third party, government or otherwise, between January 2020 and January 2025, “referring or relating to the moderation, deletion, suppression, restriction, or reduced circulation of the content, input, or output of an AI model, training dataset, algorithm, system, or product.” \nThe subpoenas are the latest move in the GOP’s long-running and innumerable investigations into whether tech companies were suppressing right-wing ideology on their platforms, and narrowed in on potential interference from the Biden administration over the past several years. But this inquiry is particularly vast: its broad request for any document that ever discussed AI content restrictions over the past five years, as well as its targeting of software companies that are not media platforms, such as Adobe, Nvidia and Palantir, represents the party’s escalation against the industry. \nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Microsoft today announced that it will officially retire Skype on May 5, 2025, concluding its 14-year tenure as the owner of the once-dominant internet calling and messaging service (via Bloomberg).\nMicrosoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion in what was then its largest-ever acquisition. At its peak, Skype had more than 300 million monthly active users and was synonymous with internet-based voice and video calling. The service steadily declined in relevance in recent years, with its active user base shrinking to approximately 36 million by 2023 as competitors such as Zoom, WhatsApp, and Microsoft's own Teams platform gained traction.\nTeams has since grown to 320 million monthly users, far surpassing Skype's remaining user base. The company's decision to discontinue Skype is apparently part of a broader effort to prioritize artificial intelligence features within Teams. Employees currently working on Skype will be reassigned to other projects rather than being laid off.\nSkype played a key role in popularizing VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology, enabling businesses and individuals to connect around the world with minimal costs. It also served as an early testbed for AI-powered real-time language translation, a feature Microsoft showcased in a widely publicized demonstration in 2014. However, its frequent UI changes, reliability issues, ill-conceived social media-like features, gradual shift toward enterprise, and inability to keep pace with newer competitors, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately led to its obsolescence.\nAs Microsoft finalizes the shutdown process, existing Skype users will have until May 5 to migrate their data and contacts to Teams or seek alternative solutions. \nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\nNew visual intelligence features for iPhone 16 models, tweaks for notification summaries, and more.\nApple Intelligence is what Apple is calling its artificial intelligence feature set, previewed at WWDC in June 2024.

            "full_content": "Microsoft recently appeared to scale back its data center development pipeline, which would be an extraordinary step back after a period of furious growth by the tech giant. But did it really?\nThe concerns about whether air was coming out of a data center bubble were raised by a TD Cowen analyst, Michael Elias, in a report dated February 21. Elias wrote that Microsoft, one of the largest data center operators in the country, had recently torn up leases for \"multiple +100 megawatt deals in multiple markets that were in early/mid-stages of negotiations.\"\nElias also said the company had let go of more than a gigawatt of preliminary data center commitments it had made and also five longer-term development deals in prime data center markets. The company's decision-making was \"tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position.\"\nMicrosoft's pullback sent a shudder through the data center market, which has seen staggering forecasts for growth in the coming years.\nFor some, however, the news simply reflected a more modest revision of the sector's extraordinary recent projections for growth.\n\"I can't think of the big five that haven't done this every 12 or 18 months,\" said one data center development executive, referring to the industry's largest users: Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle. The executive did not want to be identified by name because major customers in the industry prize confidentiality.\n\"This is not new and definitely not the biggest one we've had in the last three years,\" the executive said, saying that Meta had canceled major data center commitments it had in recent years in order to reset its strategy, including its data center business's customer and technology focus.\nAfter that reevaluation, Meta rebooted its torrid growth, including the recent announcement of a $10 billion data center campus in Louisiana.\nA spokeswoman for Meta  declined to comment. \nDan Thompson, an analyst at S&P Global who covers the data center industry, said that the magnitude of the data center boom was bound to modulate because the projections included speculative projects and, potentially, the double counting of tenants who may have expressed interest in multiple projects and/or regions for the same requirement.\n\"Some of these announcements are not going to get built,\" Thompson said. \"I don't see it as a reflection on the data center industry.\"\nThompson said that there was a need to differentiate between credible growth and the frothiest forecasts for the industry's expansion. He said that S&P plans to reorganize its data center projections this year into buckets that group projects based on their likelihood of coming to fruition.\n\"We are modifying our reports this year, for every market, basically draw the line in the sand and say, OK, this is the part where we think: that is real,\" Thompson said.\nWhat is clear, nonetheless, is that a data center boom is afoot across the nation.\nS&P Global projects that the industry will grow from about 35.4 gigawatts of capacity today to almost 82 gigawatts by the end of the decade, an 131% increase. There have been even more ambitious projections that more than 90 gigawatts of data centers could be online by 2029.\nThe development is being undertaken to commercialize and develop artificial intelligence and also cater to society's yawning digital footprint. Data centers provide the computing and storage that power the internet and a host of increasingly vital functions, such as autonomous vehicles, Zoom meetings, and cloud computing.\nA spokeswoman for Microsoft suggested in a statement that the company had pumped the brakes on development, while also highlighting the enormous scale of its data center expansion.\n\"Thanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,\" the spokeswoman stated. \"Last year alone, we added more capacity than any prior year in history.\"\nMicrosoft \"will continue to grow strongly in all regions,\" she said, and that the company's plans to \"spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.\"\nElias's report didn't cite specific examples of Microsoft's retrenchment, except for the recent news of its decision to reevaluate a large data center campus it is building in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, outside of Milwaukee.\nReached by phone, Elias declined to comment further.\nSean Ryan, a spokesman for the Village of Mount Pleasant, said that Microsoft had \"paused in some of its construction work in order to incorporate new data center designs\" and that \"Village officials have no reason to believe this will affect the overall scope or nature\" of the project."

It arrived on Xbox Game Pass on the day it was released in 2023. Now, Microsoft has removed it from the service. \nMicrosoft hoiked Lies of P after its developer, Neowiz, announced it would release the game's first downloadable content, a prequel called Lies of P: Overture, this summer. So, if you played this game when it was released in 2023 and need a refresher before the DLC's release, you'll have to buy it separately now. \nMicrosoft also removed a few other games from the service, including Yakuza 5 Remastered and Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. This further reduces the number of Yakuza games on the service after Microsoft removed the Yakuza 3 and 4 remasters from the service on Feb. 28. \nHere's the full list of games Microsoft removed from Xbox Game Pass: \nWhile Microsoft removed those games from Game Pass, it also added six games to different service tiers. Here are the games Microsoft added to the service in March. You can also check out games Microsoft added to the service in February, including CNET's pick for the best game of 2024, Balatro. \nPlaying co-op games with a friend can be fun, and this game asks, \"What if you played those games with over 30 other people?\" This game is a co-op action-roguelike that 33 people can play together. You're all damned souls rebelling against God's judgment by fighting against hordes of monsters and massive bosses. Upgrade your soul with new relics and expand your arsenal with new weapons in your fight for survival.\nHell has frozen over and the celestial forces of heaven are coming to extinguish the last burning pyre, and it's up to you to stop them. Monster Train is a unique roguelike deck builder with a twist that spreads your playing field out to three vertical areas in the train. With over 250 cards and six monster clans to call on, you'll have plenty of ways to ward off your enemies and take back your home in Hell. \nXbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can already play this game, and Game Pass Standard subscribers can play this resource-management game, too. You play as the director of an intergalactic hospital, and it's up to you to help cure as many different species of aliens as possible if they can afford it. Design, furnish and upgrade your hospital as you see fit, hire the right doctors and keep everyone happy. Just make sure you get paid first. This game definitely doesn't sound like a scathing indictment of any real-world health care system. That would be silly. \nYou're a pioneer in this cozy farming sim, but you aren't restoring your deceased grandfather's rundown old farm in this game. You're building a life on an alien planet. You must terraform the land to grow and cultivate organic and genetically modified crops. You'll also raise robo-livestock and use drones to fish and forage, but you can still romance other settlers in the area. So get out there and make this planet your home. \nMore than two years after Microsoft removed this game from Game Pass, this gunfight dungeon crawler is back. Shoot, loot and doge your way through a procedurally generated labyrinth on a quest to find the ultimate weapon: a gun that can kill the past. You'll chat with merchants, shoot enemies armed to the teeth and discover hidden secrets throughout the dungeon. \nThis first-person shooter is like a cyberpunk version of the neon-drenched game Hotline Miami. You have 10 seconds to live, and the only thing that can keep you alive is killing your robotic enemies. But you aren't just randomly taking down robots -- you're also on a mission to rescue someone called the \"Influencer\" from a skyscraper. So pick your favorite weapon and climb each floor as fast as possible to survive and save the princess, I mean Influencer.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate — a CNET Editors' Choice Award pick — offers hundreds of games you can play on your Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, computer and mobile device for $20 a month.

            "full_content": "After six years, Microsoft has officially released four methods for fixing the “Try that again” or “0x80131500” Microsoft Store error. The bug was first reported in 2019, but the good news is that there is now an official solution for you.\nYou can fix the “Try that again” error by resetting the Microsoft Store app, using the Microsoft Store troubleshooter (Windows 10 only), checking for updates, and updating your internet’s TLS (Transport Layer Security) settings. However, Microsoft recommends enabling TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 for compatibility. However, if the first three methods don’t work, the issue may be due to TLS incompatibility. If this sounds too technical, don’t worry; just follow these steps: press the Windows key > search for Run > type inetcpl.cpl > press enter > click Advanced tab to ensure that the Use TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are checked. That’s all there is to it.\nBefore these official solutions, you may have turned to different workarounds. You possibly paused the antivirus protection (even if it was one of the best antivirus software), created a new local Windows account, turned off your VPN, or maybe even logged in with Safe mode turned on. So, what causes the 0x80131500 error? Various potential causes include an unstable Internet connection, firewall blocking access, incorrect proxy settings, or even a missing Windows update.\nMicrosoft hasn’t explained why releasing this official solution for the Microsoft Store bug took so long, but at least they’re here for everyone. If, after trying all the suggested solutions, you still need more help, you can contact Microsoft Support to continue looking for a possible fix for your Windows-related issue.\nMicrosoft 365 apps will encourage users to back up their files to OneDrive, as announced in a new Message Center entry, to improve data security. Microsoft will display a prompt across Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in the following months to prevent data loss and ensure users can access their important files seamlessly.\nMicrosoft will begin showing these prompts in mid-March 2025, encouraging users to sign up for the OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM). The public preview will last until early April 2025 but will generally be available by May 2025. What is KFM? It's a feature in OneDrive that lets you sync and back up your important local folders, such as Desktop or Documents. Afterward, you can easily access your files across various devices.\nIt’s no secret that Apple’s App Store has its problems, but it generally works pretty well. Yet there’s one thing about it that just feels absolutely useless: the reviews section.\nApple highlights a few reviews on each app’s page, but infuriatingly, they’re often from many years ago. It’s not uncommon to see reviews complaining about issues that have long-since been fixed, yet they still get highlighted. When your initial impression is based on completely inappropriate information, it makes the review section borderline useless and is a terrible way to sum up information about an app.\nMicrosoft has today launched a dedicated Copilot app for Mac. For now, the app is only available for users in the US and UK, but it’s already loaded with the latest and greatest tricks from Microsoft, such as the new Think Deeper mode.\nThe only system requirement is that your machine must be running macOS 14, or a later version. On the hardware side, any Mac with an M1 silicon, or newer processor from Apple, is compatible with the app.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

            "full_content": "Tecnología, ciencia y cultura digital\t\t\t\t\nAl cierre de Skype hay que sumarle otro servicio que la compañía ofrecía en Windows y que dejará de funcionar más pronto que tarde. Microsoft ha confirmado que el día 27 de mayo dejará de dar soporte a Escritorio Remoto, uno de los programas más útiles y longevos del sistema operativo. Durante años ha ofrecido una función superútil para usuarios y empresas, permitiendo controlar PCs de forma remota a través de Internet. En 2025 toca decirle adiós. \nEscritorio Remoto es uno de esos programas que no todo el mundo utiliza, pero que cuando lo necesitas está ahí. Es sencillo y apenas ha visto actualizaciones a lo largo de los años, aunque tampoco ha sido necesario. Da lo que promete: la posibilidad de controlar un PC desde otro ordenador Windows para solucionar problemas o trabajar a distancia. Todo con una conexión estable y una buena seguridad. \nPues bien, ahora toca despedirse de su funcionalidad. Microsoft va a dejar de dar soporte a este Escritorio Remoto y eliminará el programa de su tienda el día 27 de mayo. Seguirá estando disponible para los usuarios que lo tengan descargado en Windows, aunque no recibirá más actualizaciones y varias de las últimas funciones dejarán de estar disponibles. \nNo son rumores ni filtraciones: la propia Microsoft ha confirmado en una publicación que el día 27 de mayo dejará de ofrecer soporte a Escritorio Remoto en Windows. Esto significa que no verá más novedades y que los problemas de seguridad no se solventarán. Además, es probable que a lo largo del año deje de funcionar para aquellos que lo tenían instalado. \nDe hecho, dependiendo del uso que le hayas dado a Escritorio Remoto en Windows, puede que dentro de varias semanas sea completamente inútil. Microsoft ha anunciado que la fecha límite también será el punto de inflexión para que este programa deje su sinergia con Microsoft 365 y el escritorio virtual de Azure.\nPor lo tanto, aunque la conexión remota entre PCs siga estando disponible —no sabemos por cuanto tiempo—, a partir del día 27 de mayo no será tan seguro utilizar el programa: si se encuentra alguna vulnerabilidad, los hackers podrán explotarla sin que Microsoft ponga solución. Y, conociendo el nivel de permisos que suele pedir esta aplicación en Windows, no es demasiado recomendable estar bajo esta situación.\nMicrosoft ha querido calmar las aguas poniendo un sustituto encima de la mesa: Windows App. Se trata de un servicio interesante si utilizabas Escritorio Remoto con una suscripción a Microsoft 365 o con el escritorio virtual de Azure, pero no para controlar otros PCs desde ubicaciones remotas. \nEsta última función no está disponible en Windows App, por lo que la característica protagonista de Escritorio Remoto no tiene una alternativa oficial por parte de Microsoft. Al menos por ahora, pues la gran M podría actualizar este servicio para que incluya ese control remoto de ordenadores. \nHasta ese momento, y después de sobrepasar la barrera límite del 27 de mayo, parece que utilizar herramientas de terceros como TeamViewer será lo más sensato cuando quieras compartir tu escritorio con otro PC, sea Windows o no."

Phi-4-multimodal es el primer modelo de la compañía capaz de procesar simultáneamente habla, visión y texto. La nueva IA del gigante tecnológico se desempeña de forma notable en tareas de reconocimiento de voz o traducción, aunque queda corto en otras pruebas frente a los modelos de la competencia.\nDe acuerdo con una publicación en la web de Microsoft. Phi-4-multimodal está construido sobre una arquitectura de 5.600 millones de parámetros. El modelo utiliza una mezcla de LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) para integrar diferentes modalidades de entrada en un espacio de representación unificado. Una de las ventajas de usar técnicas de aprendizaje cruzado entre modalidades es que mejora el razonamiento y permite interacciones más contextuales.\nMicrosoft afirma que su nuevo modelo cuenta con un vocabulario más amplio y soporte multilingüe, mejorando su precisión en el procesamiento del lenguaje. Además, Phi-4-multimodal soporta inferencia de baja latencia, lo que permite ejecutarlo en dispositivos móviles y equipos de gama de entrada.\nSegún comentan sus desarrolladores, Phi-4-multimodal está diseñado para la eficiencia y escalabilidad, dos términos que se han vuelto populares en los últimos meses. La llegada de DeepSeek y la explosión de modelos pequeños han hecho que desarrolladores consideren los SLM como alternativa ante un LLM. La arquitectura de este nuevo modelo mejora la velocidad y precisión del procesamiento, soportando entradas multilingües e integrando el razonamiento del lenguaje con datos multimodales.\nEn términos de rendimiento, Phi-4-multimodal supera a modelos especializados como WhisperV3 y SeamlessM4T-v2-Large en pruebas de reconocimiento automático de voz y traducción de voz. El modelo de Microsoft también consigue buenas calificaciones en capacidades de visión, incluyendo Reconocimiento Óptico de Caracteres (OCR), comprensión de documentos y gráficos, así como razonamiento científico visual.\nSu arquitectura compacta compite eficazmente con modelos más grandes — como Gemini-2-Flash-lite y Claude-3.5-Sonnet — en capacidades multimodales generales. A pesar de estos logros, Phi-4-multimodal no se desempeña muy bien en tareas de preguntas y respuestas basadas en voz, donde queda rezagado respecto a modelos como Gemini-2.0-Flash y GPT-4o.\nEsta brecha se atribuye a su tamaño de modelo más pequeño, que limita su capacidad para retener una cantidad mayor de conocimientos factuales. Microsoft comentó que está trabajando activamente en mejorar esta capacidad en futuras iteraciones.\nJunto a Phi-4-multimodal, Microsoft presentó Phi-4-mini, un modelo orientado a tareas basadas en texto. Su arquitectura permite un procesamiento eficiente de entradas de texto sin sacrificar la precisión ni la velocidad, lo que lo convierte en una opción ideal para aplicaciones que requieren comprensión avanzada del lenguaje natural (como chatbots o asistentes virtuales).\nPhi-4-multimodal y Phi-4-min están disponibles a partir de hoy en plataformas como Azure AI Foundry, HuggingFace y el Catálogo de API de NVIDIA."

            "full_content": "Tecnología, ciencia y cultura digital\t\t\t\t\nMicrosoft ha dado un paso importante en su estrategia de inteligencia artificial con Copilot. El gigante tecnológico anunció que ofrecerá gratis y sin limitaciones el acceso a los modelos de voz y razonamiento de OpenAI. Aquellos que deseen realizar una consulta en o1 no tendrán que pagar por una suscripción a ChatGPT Plus, ya que podrán hacerlo sin coste en Copilot Think Deeper.\nEn una entrada publicada en su blog de IA, Microsoft reveló que expandirá las capacidades de Copilot al ofrecer acceso gratuito e ilimitado a las funciones Think Deeper y Voz. El anuncio se da a unas semanas de la integración del modelo de razonamiento o1 de OpenAI y tiene como objetivo mejorar las conversaciones y la resolución de problemas complejos.\nAnteriormente, las funciones de Voz y Think Deeper estaban limitadas para los usuarios gratuitos, pero Microsoft ha eliminado ahora estas restricciones. Voz permite a los usuarios entablar conversaciones prolongadas con Copilot utilizando lenguaje natural, una característica que ya vemos en el modo avanzado de voz de ChatGPT. Por otro lado, Think Deeper, está diseñado para la resolución de problemas y la toma de decisiones avanzadas.\nEste último utiliza los algoritmos avanzados de OpenAI para abordar preguntas intrincadas, profundizar sobre cualquier tema o planificar proyectos. \"Think Deeper es útil para abordar temas más complejos, como realizar una compra importante, evaluar el valor futuro de una renovación del hogar o planificar un cambio de carrera\", menciona Microsoft.\nLa integración o1 de OpenAI representa un avance significativo en las capacidades de razonamiento de Copilot. A diferencia de las versiones anteriores, este modelo emplea técnicas avanzadas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, lo que permite diálogos más coherentes y con mayor conciencia de contexto.\nLa tecnológica ha subido la apuesta y quiere posicionar a Copilot como una alternativa frente a sus competidores. El ofrecer acceso sin restricciones al modelo más avanzado de OpenAI representa un salto considerable, sobre todo si consideramos que la empresa dirigida por Sam Altman restringe su uso a 2 consultas por mes. Este movimiento hace que Microsoft pueda hacer frente a DeepSeek y otros modelos de IA gratuitos que ofrecen razonamiento.\nSi bien esto puede sonar atractivo a primera vista, lo cierto es que habilitar las capacidades de Voz y Think Deeper a todos los usuarios de Copilot tendrá un efecto negativo. Microsoft avisó que podrían presentarse retrasos o interrupciones durante períodos de alta demanda. Esto se debe a que las funciones de razonamiento requieren un inmenso poder de cómputo para llevarlas a cabo.\nComo ha ocurrido en otras ocasiones que se añaden modelos de OpenAI a Copilot, Microsoft mantendrá el acceso preferencial a los usuarios de pago cuando se presenten estos contratiempos."

Como has podido leer en el título: Microsoft va a cerrar Skype dentro de poco. La espera ha sido eterna para muchos, pues la muerte de este servicio lleva años siendo una realidad. Cuando parecía que la gran M iba a dar el paso, lanzaba una nueva actualización para añadir algún tipo de soporte o novedad, y así durante bastante tiempo. \nAhora, parece que todo llega a su fin. Microsoft no ha anunciado nada oficialmente, pero un usuario ha encontrado una serie de líneas de código verdaderamente reveladoras en la app de Skype. La más importante dice, \"A partir de mayo, Skype no estará disponible. Continúa con tus llamadas y chats en Teams\". \nA pesar de que Microsoft no ha movido ficha todavía, todo apunta a que Skype cerrará sus puertas en pocas semanas. Concretamente, en algún momento del mes de mayo, culminando una vida en Internet de nada más y nada menos que casi 22 años online. \nSe lanzó un 29 de agosto de 2003, y aunque desde hace unos años está en desuso para muchos de sus antiguos usuarios, durante buena parte de su vida Skype ha sido una de las herramientas más populares de Internet. Marcó una era para muchos, democratizando la posibilidad de hacer videollamadas gratuitas desde cualquier parte del mundo. \nPor suerte, la decisión de Microsoft no pilla por sorpresa a nadie. Skype lleva años mostrando mensajes que invitan a moverse a Teams para mejorar la calidad y tener más herramientas, algo que se ha intensificado desde hace unos meses. Y, aunque no hay datos que reflejen su cuota de mercado, es probable que el uso de la plataforma azul para videollamadas sea residual en estos momentos. \nAdemás, tampoco deja a ningún usuario tirado: hace tiempo que la plataforma no cuenta con suscripciones o planes de pago a lago plazo. Tampoco hay motivos para enfadarse por carecer de su servicio principal, pues desde hace unos años el mercado está lleno de herramientas para realizar videollamadas gratuitas de calidad. \nDe hecho, como ya hemos comentado, la propia Microsoft promociona el paso a Teams, su plataforma para trabajar que, además, cuenta con un servicio de videollamadas de calidad y muy versátil. \nYa no hay vuelta atrás, y aunque no sabemos cómo se cerrará Skype, lo más probable es que en algún momento del mes de mayo el servicio deje de funcionar cuando vayas a utilizarlo. Para que no te pille de sopetón, lo más recomendable es que vayas buscando una alternativa. Si es que todavía usabas Skype, claro."

Reviews ethics statement\n\n    The service also removed more Yakuza games.\n  \nLies of P is an award-winning game that reimagines the story of Pinocchio as a soulslike action RPG set in a grimy world overrun by killer mechanical puppets. It arrived on Xbox Game Pass on the day it was released in 2023. Now, Microsoft has removed it from the service. \nMicrosoft hoiked Lies of P after its developer, Neowiz, announced it would release the game's first downloadable content, a prequel called Lies of P: Overture, this summer. So, if you played this game when it was released in 2023 and need a refresher before the DLC's release, you'll have to buy it separately now. \nMicrosoft also removed a few other games from the service, including Yakuza 5 Remastered and Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. This further reduces the number of Yakuza games on the service after Microsoft removed the Yakuza 3 and 4 remasters from the service on Feb. 28. \nHere's the full list of games Microsoft removed from Xbox Game Pass: \nWhile Microsoft removed those games from Game Pass, it also added six games to different service tiers. Here are the games Microsoft added to the service in March. You can also check out games Microsoft added to the service in February, including CNET's pick for the best game of 2024, Balatro. \nPlaying co-op games with a friend can be fun, and this game asks, \"What if you played those games with over 30 other people?\" This game is a co-op action-roguelike that 33 people can play together. You're all damned souls rebelling against God's judgment by fighting against hordes of monsters and massive bosses. Upgrade your soul with new relics and expand your arsenal with new weapons in your fight for survival.\nHell has frozen over and the celestial forces of heaven are coming to extinguish the last burning pyre, and it's up to you to stop them. Monster Train is a unique roguelike deck builder with a twist that spreads your playing field out to three vertical areas in the train. With over 250 cards and six monster clans to call on, you'll have plenty of ways to ward off your enemies and take back your home in Hell. \nXbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can already play this game, and Game Pass Standard subscribers can play this resource-management game, too. You play as the director of an intergalactic hospital, and it's up to you to help cure as many different species of aliens as possible if they can afford it. Design, furnish and upgrade your hospital as you see fit, hire the right doctors and keep everyone happy. Just make sure you get paid first. This game definitely doesn't sound like a scathing indictment of any real-world health care system. That would be silly. \nYou're a pioneer in this cozy farming sim, but you aren't restoring your deceased grandfather's rundown old farm in this game. You're building a life on an alien planet. You must terraform the land to grow and cultivate organic and genetically modified crops. You'll also raise robo-livestock and use drones to fish and forage, but you can still romance other settlers in the area. So get out there and make this planet your home. \nMore than two years after Microsoft removed this game from Game Pass, this gunfight dungeon crawler is back. Shoot, loot and doge your way through a procedurally generated labyrinth on a quest to find the ultimate weapon: a gun that can kill the past. You'll chat with merchants, shoot enemies armed to the teeth and discover hidden secrets throughout the dungeon. \nThis first-person shooter is like a cyberpunk version of the neon-drenched game Hotline Miami. You have 10 seconds to live, and the only thing that can keep you alive is killing your robotic enemies. But you aren't just randomly taking down robots -- you're also on a mission to rescue someone called the \"Influencer\" from a skyscraper. So pick your favorite weapon and climb each floor as fast as possible to survive and save the princess, I mean Influencer.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate — a CNET Editors' Choice Award pick — offers hundreds of games you can play on your Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, computer and mobile device for $20 a month.

            "full_content": "When President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, he said the massive AI infrastructure project—a joint venture formed by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank—would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately.\"\nLittle evidence supports the accuracy of Trump's statement, though he wouldn't be the first politician to suggest that data centers are a boon for job creation. The data center industry has grown rapidly in recent years, and state governors have touted the jobs it would create.\nA new study from PwC supports these claims, reporting that data centers contributed 4.7 million jobs to national employment in 2023, up 60% from 2017. While the data center market has grown rapidly in recent years and has been fueled by the rise of cloud computing and AI, most of those jobs aren't direct tech jobs. Economic development experts are divided over the accuracy of the study, which was sponsored by data center industry lobbying group Data Center Coalition.\nBig Tech companies spent a combined estimated $246 billion in capital expenditures last year, much of which was on data center expansion. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are expected to spend another $320 billion in capital expenditures this year.\nState and local government officials have touted the number of jobs that would result from all the new development. However, once built, data center facilities don't employ large numbers of permanent employees, and the economic development contracts they sign in exchange for tax incentives often reflect that.\nIn a press release announcing Amazon's $10 billion data center expansion in Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said in December that the investment would support \"thousands\" of jobs. Documents filed with the Ohio Department of Development showed that Amazon is committed to creating 1,058 new jobs, none of which are required to be full-time, salaried positions.\nOf the 4.7 million jobs attributed to the data center industry in the PwC study, only 603,900 were actual industry jobs, otherwise known as \"direct\" jobs.\nThe Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group that counts Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta as members, commissioned the PwC study, which grouped jobs into three categories — \"direct,\" \"indirect,\" and \"induced.\"\nA \"direct\" job, the study said, is any job — full-time, part-time, or self-employed — tied to the operation of the data center. An \"indirect\" job refers to a full-time, part-time, or self-employed job created to produce necessary goods and services in a data center's supply chain. \"Induced\" jobs are jobs that result from spending that occurs in an area due to the data center's presence there.\nNearly 4.1 million data center jobs — the vast majority of the total number of data center jobs accounted for in PwC's study — were considered indirect and induced. Indirect and induced jobs can comprise a wide range of potential positions, from the construction and maintenance of data centers to jobs in the local service industry near the data centers. The service sector, which includes everything from tourism, hospitality, and retail, to healthcare and financial services, accounted for 60% of the data center industry's induced jobs.\n\"DCC asked PwC to quantify the economic contributions made by the data center industry nationally as well as in each state and the District of Columbia. The report and analysis were conducted independently by PwC using publicly available government data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics,\" a Data Center Coalition spokesperson said.\nSome economists say induced and indirect jobs can be difficult to accurately quantify.\nNathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas's Department of Government, questioned the study's estimate of the number of jobs created by the data center industry.\n\"The economic impact of these projects aren't particularly high,\" Jensen said. \"It's head-shaking to me how you could come up with that jobs number.\"\nPwC used IMPLAN, an economic modeling software that is considered an industry standard for economic impact analysis and data. While IMPLAN has been used since the late 1970s to demonstrate potential job creation for a variety of industries, Jensen said the program is vulnerable to misuse.\n\"There's a lot of controversy around IMPLAN,\" he said. \"It's often used to justify economic development incentives.\"\nIMPLAN's model relies on the North American Industry Classification System, which the federal government uses to classify businesses, to determine the \"multiplier effect\" of an economic development project to measure the overall impact on the local economy.\nPwC determined that the data center industry has a multiplier effect of 7.5, meaning that every direct data center job leads to another 7.5 jobs elsewhere in the US economy.\nJensen said a multiplier effect of one or two is likely more accurate.\nData centers do offer significant job creation opportunities, said John Boyd Jr., principal at site selection advisory The Boyd Co. — it's just that the jobs are in unexpected places.\nConstruction jobs are bigger and more important to the data center industry than people realize, he said. Boyd's firm has helped large corporations like AT&T, Dell, and Visa choose locations for major development projects, and it has also advised government agencies on economic development deals.\n\"The actual amount of on-site labor is enormous, and wages are over double the national average for construction workers,\" Boyd said of data center projects.\nThis is because data center construction requires skilled labor across a variety of expertise.\n\"You're looking at cooling systems, natural gas turbines, specialized server equipment,\" he said.\nConstruction workers often travel to data center sites and stay for extended periods of time, which leads to a need for hotels, restaurants, and other services. The data center development boom has led to a surge in occupancy rates at properties owned by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, CEO Geoff Ballotti said on the company earnings call in February.\nData centers also require routine and specialized maintenance after they are built, leading to a continued need for skilled labor nearby.\nThe industry tends to cluster together. Once one data center is located in a certain area, others tend to follow. Ballotti said Wyndham's business development experts are focusing on expansion in areas near Jackson, Mississippi, and Columbus, Ohio, because of that.\n\"These aren't one and done,\" Boyd said."

            "full_content": "Melinda French Gates, 60, isn't looking back after her divorce from Bill Gates.\nIn an interview with Elle published on Monday, French Gates spoke about the dissolution of her marriage to the Microsoft founder.\n\"Look, divorces are painful, and it's not something I would wish on any family,\" French Gates told Elle.\nThe philanthropist, who shares three children with Gates, said that ending her marriage was one of the hardest yet most significant decisions she's ever made, per Elle.\nThe pair first met in 1987, shortly after French Gates started working at Microsoft as a product manager. After seven years of dating, they married in 1994. In May 2021, they announced they were ending their marriage after 27 years, and their divorce was finalized in August.\nFrench Gates also said she was not interested in dating at the moment.\n\"But again, I knew when I got divorced, I would be okay on my own. And I think that was the most important thing,\" French Gates said.\nShe had a hopeful answer when asked what she wanted someone to know about her if they Googled her five years from now.\n\"She's thriving on the other side of a divorce,\" French Gates said. \"Just thriving.\"\nFrench Gates' comments come after her ex-husband told The Times in January that their split \"was the mistake I most regret.\"\n\"You would have to put that at the top of the list,\" Gates said when asked if the divorce was his only failure in life. \"There are others but none that matter. The divorce thing was miserable for me and Melinda for at least two years.\"\nThe Microsoft founder added that he and French Gates still see each other at family events.\nIn the wake of their split in 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that French Gates had been seeking a divorce since 2019 when it was publicly revealed that Gates had met with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein multiple times. There were also reports of Gates' extramarital affairs during his tenure as Microsoft CEO.\nIn a 2022 CBS interview with Gayle King, French Gates described her emotions after the divorce and said she was \"grieving\" the loss of something she thought she had for a lifetime.\n\"I had a lot of tears for many days,\" French Gates said, recalling how she would lie on the floor and think, \"How can this be? How can I get up? How am I going to move forward?\"\nThe former couple did not have a prenuptial agreement and split their property according to a separation contract. Following their split, Gates transferred over $6 billion worth of stock to French Gates.\nAccording to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index today, French Gates's net worth is about $15 billion.\nA representative for French Gates did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours."

            "full_content": "Initially, the fusion energy produced will support a purchase agreement with Microsoft.\nThe Helion fusion power facility is planned to be situated on Rock Island Dam Road in Malaga.\nHelion Energy, an Everett-based fusion energy company, has announced plans to construct the world’s first fusion power plant in Malaga, Washington. \nThe company is working towards developing a 50-megawatt fusion power plant on land owned by the Chelan Public Utility District (PUD) near Rock Island Dam, along the Chelan County side of the Columbia River. \nWhile the site has not been officially finalized yet, discussions are progressing, and the company plans to further engage with the community for this pioneering project. \nThe announcement was made during a joint press conference at the Confluence Technology Center in Wenatchee. The public event featured Helion Communications Director Jessie Barton, Chelan PUD’s Kirk Hudson, Chelan County Community Development Director Deanna Walter, and Jim Kuntz of the Chelan Douglas Regional Port Authority. \nThey discussed their respective agencies’ roles in exploring the potential for carbon-free energy sources in Chelan County.\n“We’re looking at developing a 50-megawatt fusion power plant on PUD-owned land, near Rock Island Dam, on the Chelan side of the Columbia River,” said Barton. “Now, this isn’t an official site selection at this point, but we are at the point where we’re ready to bring in more community members and have a larger conversation about this potential project.” \nA community event is planned for March 11 at Mission View Elementary School, where additional details about the project will be shared. The company has set an ambitious timeline, aiming to begin construction this summer if the permitting process proceeds without delays, to generate fusion energy by 2028.\nFrom Chelan PUD’s perspective, this project is a key component of a broader strategy to meet future energy demands and expand beyond hydropower, which has traditionally been the region’s primary energy source.  “We have all of our eggs in one basket with hydropower, which has served us very well, but the future is going to be much different than the past has been,” said Chelan PUD’s Kirk Hudson. \nInitially, the fusion energy produced will support a purchase agreement with Microsoft, with long-term plans to make this clean energy accessible to local customers.\nThe PUD remains optimistic about the project’s growth and success, aiming for its benefits to extend to residents of Chelan County and the broader north-central Washington region. \nFormal discussions regarding agreements with Helion, including potential lease terms, are expected once the company is ready to begin construction.\nHelion Energy anticipates hiring approximately 130 workers during the initial construction phase, with around 30 staff needed for ongoing plant operations once the facility is complete.\nIn May 2023, Helion Energy announced a groundbreaking deal with Microsoft, marking the world’s first commercial agreement for fusion energy. \nUnder this agreement, Helion aims to provide Microsoft with electricity generated from its fusion power plant by 2028. The deal underscores confidence in Helion’s advanced fusion technology and its potential to deliver a reliable, carbon-free energy source. \nThis partnership aligns with Microsoft’s sustainability goals, aiming to secure clean energy for its operations. Helion’s progress has been further bolstered by significant funding, including a major investment in January 2025, to accelerate the development and deployment of fusion energy technology. \nWith the planned fusion power plant in Malaga, Washington, Helion is taking significant strides toward making fusion energy a reality, reinforcing its commitment to revolutionizing the energy landscape by 2028.\nAamir Khollam Aamir is a seasoned tech journalist with experience at Exhibit Magazine, Republic World, and PR Newswire.

            "full_content": "The tale of the Microsoft Xbox Kinect is one of those sad situations where a great product was used in an application that turned out to be a bit of a flop and was discontinued because of it, despite its usefulness in other areas. This article from the Guardian is a quick read on how this handy depth camera has found other uses in somewhat niche areas, with not a computer game in sight.\nIt’s rather obvious that a camera that can generate a 3D depth map, in parallel with a 2D reference image, could have many applications beyond gaming, especially in the hands of us hackers. Potential uses include autonomous roving robots, 3D scanning, and complex user interfaces—there are endless possibilities. Artists producing interactive art exhibits would sit firmly in that last category, with the Kinect used in countless installations worldwide.\nApparently, the Kinect also has quite the following in ghost-hunting circles, which as many a dubious TV show would demonstrate, seem almost entirely filmed under IR light conditions. The Kinect’s IR-based structured light system is well-suited for these environments. Since its processing core runs a machine learning application specifically trained to track human figures, it’s no surprise that the device can pick up those invisible, pesky spirits hiding in the noise. Anyway, all of these applications depend on the used-market supply of Kinect devices, over a decade old, that can be found online and in car boot sales, which means one day, the Kinect really will die off, only to be replaced with specialist devices that cost orders of magnitude more to acquire.\nIn the unlikely event you’ve not encountered non-gaming applications for the Kinect, here’s an old project to scan an entire room to get you started. Just to be perverse, here’s a gaming application that Microsoft didn’t think of, and to round out, the bad news that Microsoft has really has abandoned the product.\nTalking about the Kinect and Not a mention of the VR sandbox?\nAgreed, that is a great project.\nhttps://ar-sandbox.eu/augmented-reality-sandbox-software/\nPlease do not forget its predecessor by Oliver Kreylos at UCDavis.\nI made an instance of Oliver Kreylos’ great sARndbox for a Maker Faire:\nhttps://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/LinkDownload.html\nTHAT makes more sense because I see it’s a Linux installation and that’s what I recall since I’ve not run Windows since the late ’90s.\nWhen I was working at Mozilla, in one of my many unofficial side projects I added Kinect support to Firefox, which made the RGB camera and depth map available to normal web content via a JavaScript API. TypeArrays were just being added as an experimental feature – they were still very limited and still had a lot of performance bottlenecks, but it worked well enough. It made it really easy to play around with the data and experiment with drawing it to a Canvas element that was part of other web content. Fun times.\nIs the app available?\nFor anyone that is interested:  The older version of the Kinect is the version to snag – it is much easier to interface with via open source libraries on all the common development environments.  Because of this, there is much higher demand for the older version and ebay prices reflect that.\nIt’s been a while since I bought and tinkered with a used Kinect, so there might have been some developments cracking the newer version since I was last looking into them.\nIndeed. A peripheral killed too soon and not often enough thought of for what it’s best for. Very strange, a fairly unique case. There are Chinese knock-offs these days which interface with the same libraries which are still produced, but they aren’t as good and the documentation is very spotty. I think Lumoplay uses one.\nI got lucky then and snagged a bag full of them from shopgoodwill a decade ago\nI just had another look.  They are still selling “untested” lots for cheap. Coming to about less than $5/ea without psus\nYeah the new hardware is MUCH better but unfortunately the drivers that Microsoft provide don’t make any use of it anyway. So there is no point in getting the newer one, and the old one is easier to get going.\nI just looked into it for VRChat support (full limb tracking etc)\nMy first MakerFaire project way back in 2012 was a OpenCV app that detected the position of your hands and applied it as differential steering values to drive a Roomba around. It was a hit when it worked, but the Sun washed out the IR light which meant a lot of the day it really struggled.\nSaid project: https://blog.aaroneiche.com/2012/09/20/me-at-the-portland-makerfaire/\nOne thing to note, especially for battery powered projects like an autonomous robot, the kinect is quite power hungry.\nIt’s a bit of a faff but there are ways to bring the power cost way down, the 12v bits are needed for the motors if memory serves but the rest can run from USB.\nhttps://medium.com/robotics-weekends/how-to-turn-old-kinect-into-a-compact-usb-powered-rgbd-sensor-f23d58e10eb0\nIt was an interesting technology and great gadget to hack. It was not a ‘great product’. A great product has or creates a demand for its existence and is affordably produced to create profit and long term preferably repeat customers. Kinect was not that.\nYeah, I concur with that. It’s easy to just call everything a ‘product’ when really it’s a product of engineering that I think of. A thing. A gadget. A commercial failure. I still own three.\nMicrosoft didn’t invent the Kinect technology, they licensed it from Primesense. After Primesense worked with Google and demo’d an Android tablet with an embedded PrimeSense 3D camera, Apple purchased Primesense and mothballed it for 10+ years.\nWhen the Kinect first hit the market, Microsoft didn’t provide any 3rd party use libraries so Adafruit put out a reward for the first working library. It took about a week and then another week before Microsoft threatened to sue Adafruit. Limur didn’t back down and Microsoft backed off. The Kinect became a hit in the Linux robotics field. Asus and others also licensed the tech from Primesense and Primesense published lots of libraries for use. It all disappeared once Apple closed the deal.\nSome internet archives were around with the Primesense code last I looked over 15 years ago.\nI have seen Xbox Kinect being used at an airport for bag drop off (Changi Airport)\nI know that somewhat after Kinect was launched, some manufacturers began to offer CMOS sensors with  RGBI (Red, Green, Blue, Infrared) filters instead of Bayer ones, pointing to this kind of applications, but I can’t find them anywhere. Does anybody know if there is today a reasonably-priced USB cam with that kind of sensor/filter? (I have some ideas that I want to try, and I need that).\nDFRobot do a camera sensor that can manage to track 4 IR sources at one time, it’s incredibly popular with modern DIY lightgun projects.\nBut that isn’t what I need… I want a camera that can give me, at the same time, an infrared and a color picture.\nFunny story, Singapore Airport automated bag drop machines use Kinects. Personally confirmed 2 months ago when I was there:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1hqbe5f/bag_drops_at_singapore_airport_use_xbox_kinect/\nI love the kinect.\nI built an AR Sandbox with Oliver Kreylos’s instructions and software.\nI’m also using it as a person tracker to drive a big person-follower halloween-eye :)\nThe project has not been completely abandoned.  It morphed into Azure Kinect and the same technology has been repackaged as the Orbbec Femto Bolt.\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kinect-dk\nhttps://store.orbbec.com/products/femto-bolt\nThe XBOX Kinect is an incredible piece of hardware for what it costs. Once all the used ones finally break there is going to be a real void left. What other device can give you high resolution time of flight depth images at 30Hz for a few hundred bucks? I don’t think there are any.\nI saw them being used at Disney world. The Peter Pan line had interactive holographic butterflies I looked up and to my surprise saw the Kinect on the ceiling pointing down.\nI used the Kinect for a few dance performances. I controlled or puppeteered a character in a game engine while I danced. I have also seen them used at Arttechhouse for interactive projections\nThere is one inside of a Tempo: https://tempo.fit/studio-suite\nI remember when I was just discovering vrchat and wanted to use my xb1 kinect for tracking\nThen I learned that I needed a $300 adapter that I could only get secondhand from China to actually connect it to my pc and decided against it\nIt’s been closer to a decade now, wonder if theres a cheaper way to do that, it’s just been sitting connected to my xbox under my TV collecting dust…\nI think there is actually, I don’t know where I found it, but you can connect a normal usb 3 cable and solder some wires internally to connect a power supply and then it works, at least it did for me.\nAs someone in the paranormal community, I have used Kinect for ghost hunting.\nI think it was over 10 years ago, I was trying to test 3d scanning using a kinect as well as using a laser light projected as a horizontal beam.\nThis was for a client who was fabricating parts with their CNC for cars and motorcycles.\nI remember using David Scanner and I think there was some other software to do this. While it worked, the results were not what the client wanted as the resolution was too low.\nI think I spent a few hours tinkering with this setup. It’s great how far 3d scanning technology has come, but it’s still nowhere near the cost of a $20 laser light or your Kinect and some free software.\nThen again, you can now use your cellphone as a 3d scanner and get better results.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

            "full_content": "In a move that could have been seen coming from at least a decade away, Microsoft has confirmed that the Skype service will be shutting down on May 5. This comes after an intrepid person stumbled over a curious string in the latest Skype for Windows preview. This string seemed intended to notify the user about the impending shutdown, telling them to migrate to Teams instead.\nSkype was originally created in 2003 by a group of European developers, where it saw some success, with the service being acquired by Microsoft in 2011. Much like other messaging services, each Skype user has a unique ID, but there is also integration with phone services around the world. When Microsoft overhauled the user interface in 2017, this caused a split between ‘classic’ UI fans and the heretics who liked the new interface.\nWith Microsoft not really finding a way to stop the bleeding of users by this time, and with its nascent Teams service enjoying success despite any complaints anyone might have about it, it seems that now the time has come where Skype will be put out to pasture. For the handful of Skype users still left today, the options are to either download your data before it’s erased, or to move your user account to Teams.\nThe original Skype was technically very interesting. I remember it was developed in Delphi and contained multi-layer protection (crypting of the binary code) of the original protocol which was really hard to detect or reverse-engineer.\nThose guys knew what was their asset for sure back in the days..\nI remember some research article about reverse engineering the Skype client, and they found when they disabled the anti-debugging and anti-reverse engineering hacks the client worked faster and more stable.\nI stayed away from Skype for years, because of the Kazaa background of the creators and how much malware was bundled with Kazaa.\nI remember Delphi 7! True classic! ❤️\nWell, here we are. With ICQ another childhood/teenage memory will dissappear forever.\nNah, there are alternative servers to use.\nBut yes, the official things frlm back then are gone sadly.\nSkype could have owned the IM ecosystem today. Not only did Microsoft not innovate on Skype, but it’s like they intentionally let it rot.\nYeah, and teams is a bloated monster which still lacks one of the key features of Skype and ICQ and all these messengers, a small unobtrusive contact list. Teams sure is a vast improvement in some respects but in terms of UI, it’s a catastrophically messy nightmare and still very much single window, kind of ironic for a company that grew with an OS called Windows.\nI’ve heard that the Teams back-end grew out of the Skype back-end. If accurate, then Microsoft let the Skype brand rot, while pivoting the code to a new brand.\n…which aligns with plenty of other poor branding decisions by Microsoft.\nlast time i checked — which was fairly recently, within the last few months — the internal identifiers used for Teams channels (chatrooms) still had the string “skype” in them. so yes, they embraced and extinguished that technology, as they tend to do with everything they purchase.\nThe “business” IM product that is now Teams started as Office Communicator, went through at least two major revisions before getting rebadged into Skype for Business (SfB)(which was absolutely incompatible with Skype) and then got re-rebadged into the abomination known as Teams, along with turning into into a cloud-only service.\nGetting a SfB on-premise installation to work with other SfB instances was… difficult and a real challenge, to say the very least.\nBut at least the clients for those were not terribad, unlike the Teams Client, which is an absolute trainwreck of an app that runs like a pig even on good hardware.\nNot the first product M$ bought and killed on purpose. The list is quite long …\nOne thinks that Embrace, Extend, Extinguish is just one of the many anti-MS memes, until it happens for real.\nSkype still runs on premise for some companies. Microsoft will support until end 2025.\nGood example of how microsoft bought & kill a competitor, now offering no other choice than buy 0365 to use a visio solution….\nIt was a good run. I got my skype number and subscription in 2007. $69/yr for the number and unlimited  domestic minutes incoming and outgoing.\nLooks like its time for Google Voice/Meet. I didnt switch when duo added video capabilities because Im attached to my skype number and you can only port cell numbers over. So I guess Ill be porting the skype number to a cell phone, then port it over to google.\nI’m in a similar boat. Thanks for sharing a path out of Skype. I worked at Microsoft during the time they were merging their video conferencing product with Skype (and when they were wasting billions buying Nokia and then destroying it). I quit soon after that and am still quite pleased that I did.\nHm. It’s no surprise, but the shut-off should have been communicated sooner.\nIt’s not very professional to tell the clients/customers/users just shortly before shut-off. 6 months (half a years) to 1,5 years in advance would be fair.\nSo that the affected people can find their own alternative\n– and no, not just assume them to pick the intended replacement from same company.\nAlas, it seems like US tech giants are nolonger reliable here.\nOr maybe they never were, whatsoever.\n“and no, not just assume them to pick the intended replacement from same company”\nPerhaps you are too young to remember what they did to the millions of users of Visual Studio classic.\nI remember the petition for VB6 and how ignorant Microsoft was.\nThat was a different Microsoft, also, under different leadership.\nVB6 wasn’t switched off suddenly, also, it was being too crucial.\nDevelopment simply ended, with patches being released from time to time.\nThe core runtime, msvbvm60.dll, is still in Windows 11.\nSpeaking of, the WINE people are also ignorant, I think, because they refuse to try to provide a free substitute for msvbvm60.dll, while they simultanously provide various Visual C++ runtimes.\nThey seemingly don’t acknowledge that VB6 runtime is a true core Windows DLL since the 90s and point the finger on WineTricks instead.\nWhat makes me a bit sad these days is that those foreign IT companies seemingly have no sense for responsibility.\nThey act careless and don’t think about the consequences to others.\nWhile they can do that, of course, it hurts their reputation.\nIn moments like this I’m sad that projects like LiMux haven’t caught on.\nIt’s really time to phase out MS software and big US software in general, maybe.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux\nBecause with big power comes big responsibility and the latter is apparently something they’re not up to.\nWho knows what they do if their Fuehrer gives them orders to drop support for a given country or company.\nIf , say, MS Teams would suddenly stop working, communication in international companies would be put on hold.\nIt’s really time to think over relationships with big tech giants and look for alternatives where the plug can’t be pulled so easily.\n“When Microsoft overhauled the user interface in 2017, this”\n… started the inevitable enshittification.\nHow hard would it be to make a VoIP gateway for old landline calls inside Whatsapp or Signal? the UI could be commands like /call +324891234. Or just fork Signal to add extensions.\nI’m dumb when it comes to this VoIP stuff so hear me out.  I’ve used skype since back when you could actually have a Skype phone.  When it suddenly quit working, I had to pitch it since it and well as many thousands of others when it became e-waste overnight.  I hated it that MSoft acquired it and case in point with this announcement.  The only reason I use Skype is my elderly in-laws are in Australia and they can call me in Nebraska using a local Australian number.  Now I have no idea what I’m going to do.  I read where someone in the comments mentioned porting the number to a cell phone and then to google.  If anyone reading this can point me to a good tutorial on this, I’d be eternally grateful.  Smart phones are out of the question as they have one landline, no computer, no internet, and no smart phone.  It has to be as simple and reliable as possible and I’m stymied as to how to replicate this feature of Skype anywhere else.\nGoogle Voice only allows porting of US based numbers so the work around I posted wouldnt work for your austrailian local number. Your best bet would be to establish a new austrailian number with a different VOIP provider.\nI took a few minutes and looked at a few sites, so I cant attest to the company nor their service quality, but  australianphone.com.au seems like a good place to start. Youd probably be better off getting a new aussie phone number with them than going through the hassle of trying to port your old number since it sounds like youre just using it for family calls anyway. They have a $4AU(~$2.5US)/mo standard plan that comes with an aussie local number, Theres a per minute charge for mobile calls, and a per message charge for SMS but it sounds like that wouldnt be an issue since your inlaws use a landline.\nAgain, Ive never used them, but if I was in your boat, I think Id give them a go. Good luck!\nPS if you use their call forwarding to a US number youre on the hook for 1,3 AU¢/min.\nAlso, when you setup the account it defaults to $20/mo topup. If you arent going to be forwarding calls, using SMS or receiving mobile calls change that to $0.\nPSS Sorry if Im spamming you with info but since you said you need clear instructions to understand how to handle all of this, and Im not loving their website, so I found this link for you It explains that to make calls with their service you use a Zoiper. Its available for Apple/Android/PC https://www.australianphone.com.au/support/setup-guides/250-zoiper-configuration\nI thank you for taking the time to let me know these options.  It sounds more expensive either way as I’ve been doing this for 10 bucks a month since forever.  While I’m over there I’m going to see what it costs to add international calling to their existing bill and if it’s cheaper, pay that.\n“t sounds more expensive either way as I’ve been doing this for 10 bucks a month since forever. ”\n“They have a $4AU(~$2.5US)/mo standard plan that comes with an aussie local number”\n$2.50<$10\nIf they do not call you from a mobile phone,\nIf they do not send you SMS messages,\nif you do not forward to a US phone number but instead answer their calls with the Zoiper app on either your home computer or cell phone\nand if you remember to change the “top off” (meant to add money to account monthly to cover forwarding SMS and mobile calls)\nYou will be paying ~$2.50 USD billed as $4AU\nIm afraid you got lost in my words and just added every dollar sign together. This option will be around 1/4 the price you say youve been paying skype.\nThis is the only reason why I have a Facebook account, to have video calls with my daughter.  I’m in the US, she’s in Japan, pretty good quality on the video call.  No additional costs/fees over regular cell phone internet service.\nForsure, but my in laws have literally nothing but a phone.  Not interested in anything else.\nI love Teams, the nice white window it presents is perfect for drawing with whiteboard markers on the screen. /s Do I get my remaining Skype Credit back?\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

            "full_content": "Guests are paying millions of dollars to dine and meet with President Donald Trump at special events held at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\nBusiness leaders can secure a one-on-one meeting with the president at Mar-a-Lago for $5 million, according to sources with direct knowledge of the meetings. At a so-called candlelight dinner held as recently as this past Saturday, prospective Mar-a-Lago guests were asked to spend $1 million to reserve a seat, according to an invitation obtained by WIRED.\n“You are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest President Donald J. Trump,” the invitation reads, under a “MAGA INC.” header. MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. “Additional details provided upon RSVP. RSVPs will be accommodated on a first come, first serve basis. Space is very limited. $1,000,000 per person.”\nInvitees were asked to RSVP to Meredith O’Rourke, who served as national finance director and senior adviser at Donald J. Trump for President 2024, a campaign committee, and who is the owner of The O’Rourke Group, which O’Rourke describes on her LinkedIn page as a “Republican political fundraiser.” Invitees were also directed to email Abby Mathis, the finance coordinator at MAGA Inc. Mathis was previously a staff assistant for Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama—a former Auburn University football coach—and also served as an intern at the White House office of the staff secretary, according to LegiStorm, a research organization that posts information on politicians and their staffers.\nO’Rourke and Mathis did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House.\nThe invitation specifically states that “Donald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a featured speaker, and is not asking for funds or donations.” The event occurred at 7 pm on March 1 and was listed on the president’s official schedule as the “MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.” This is the only event by that name on Trump’s official schedule since he took office.\nMichael Solakiewicz, a pro-Trump digital creator, posted photographs of the event on Instagram. WIRED has also viewed photographs and videos of Elon Musk with his son X at Mar-a-Lago the following day during a charity event hosted by a group called Wine Women & Shoes that also featured Trump.\n“It’s everyone else who missed the boat,” a Trumpworld source with knowledge of the meetings says, referring to latecomers to the Trump agenda. The source pointed specifically to the tech sector, where executives have scrambled to show fealty to the new administration. While X owner Elon Musk notably spent at least $260 million to elect Trump, other tech companies and executives collectively donated millions to Trump’s inauguration fund: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos, Meta, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Uber, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all donated $1 million each.\nThe $5 million one-on-one meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, says a source familiar with them.\nIt’s unclear where the money is going and what it will be used for, but one source with direct knowledge of the dinners said “it’s all going to the library,” as in the presidential library that will ostensibly be built once Trump leaves office. MAGA Inc spent over $450 million to elect Trump in 2024, though Trump is not legally permitted to run for a third presidential term in 2028.\nSo-called candlelight dinners offering access to the president are known to have been held prior to Trump’s inauguration, but have not previously been reported to have occurred while he is in office. (Trump did, however, appear at a number of other fundraising events during his first term.) Most recently, The Washington Post reported that such candlelight dinners were held on December 19 and January 19—the night before Trump’s presidential inauguration—for the cost of $1 million per attendee. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attended the January 19 event. In the lead-up to Trump’s 2016 inauguration, donors who spent seven figures could secure eight tickets to a candlelight dinner, according to a Washington Post report at the time.\nWhile previous second-term presidents have held fundraisers for their parties, the nature, timing, location, and price tag of Trump’s dinner all raise flags for experts.\n“I can’t recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “The concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence … People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.”\n“Part of what is worrying,” Moynihan adds, “is the lack of ethical guardrails in the current Trump administration, where there doesn’t seem to be a clear line between Trump’s businesses and the presidency.”\nIn your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear\nMusk takeover: DOGE’s race to the bottom\nBig Story: The bust that took down Durov and upended Telegram\nWIRED’s favorite ‘buy it for life’ gear\nEvent: Join us for WIRED Health on March 18 in London\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

            "full_content": "What happens when quantum computers can finally crack encryption and break into the world’s best-kept secrets? It’s called Q-Day—the worst holiday maybe ever.\nOne day soon, at a research lab near Santa Barbara or Seattle or a secret facility in the Chinese mountains, it will begin: the sudden unlocking of the world’s secrets. Your secrets.\nCybersecurity analysts call this Q-Day—the day someone builds a quantum computer that can crack the most widely used forms of encryption. These math problems have kept humanity’s intimate data safe for decades, but on Q-Day, everything could become vulnerable, for everyone: emails, text messages, anonymous posts, location histories, bitcoin wallets, police reports, hospital records, power stations, the entire global financial system.\n“We’re kind of playing Russian roulette,” says Michele Mosca, who coauthored the most recent “Quantum Threat Timeline” report from the Global Risk Institute, which estimates how long we have left. “You’ll probably win if you only play once, but it’s not a good game to play.” When Mosca and his colleagues surveyed cybersecurity experts last year, the forecast was sobering: a one-in-three chance that Q-Day happens before 2035. And the chances it has already happened in secret? Some people I spoke to estimated 15 percent—about the same as you’d get from one spin of the revolver cylinder.\nThe corporate AI wars may have stolen headlines in recent years, but the quantum arms race has been heating up too. Where today’s AI pushes the limits of classical computing—the kind that runs on 0s and 1s—quantum technology represents an altogether different form of computing. By harnessing the spooky mechanics of the subatomic world, it can run on 0s, 1s, or anything in between. This makes quantum computers pretty terrible at, say, storing data but potentially very good at, say, finding the recipe for a futuristic new material (or your email password). The classical machine is doomed to a life of stepwise calculation: Try one set of ingredients, fail, scrap everything, try again. But quantum computers can explore many potential recipes simultaneously.\nSo, naturally, tech giants such as Google, Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft have been chasing quantum’s myriad positive applications—not only for materials science but also communications, drug development, and market analysis. China is plowing vast resources into state-backed efforts, and both the US and the European Union have pledged millions in funding to support homegrown quantum industries. Of course, whoever wins the race won’t just have the next great engine of world-saving innovation. They’ll also have the greatest code-breaking machine in history. So it’s normal to wonder: What kind of Q-Day will humanity get—and is there anything we can do to prepare?\nIf you had a universal picklock, you might tell everyone—or you might keep it hidden in your pocket for as long as you possibly could. From a typical person’s vantage point, maybe Q-Day wouldn’t be recognizable as Q-Day at all. Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London’s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships. Embarrassing material starts to show up online in greater and greater quantities: classified intelligence cables, presidential cover-ups, billionaires’ dick pics. In this scenario, it might be decades before we’re able to pin down exactly when Q-Day actually happened.\nThen again, maybe the holder of the universal picklock prefers the disaster-movie outcome: everything, everywhere, all at once. Destroy the grid. Disable the missile silos. Take down the banking system. Open all the doors and let the secrets out.\nSuppose you ask a classical computer to solve a simple math problem: Break the number 15 into its smallest prime factors. The computer would try all the options one by one and give you a near-instantaneous answer: 3 and 5. If you then ask the computer to factor a number with 1,000 digits, it would tackle the problem in exactly the same way—but the calculation would take millennia. This is the key to a lot of modern cryptography.\nTake RSA encryption, developed in the late 1970s and still used for securing email, websites, and much more. In RSA, you (or your encrypted messaging app of choice) create a private key, which consists of two or more large prime numbers. Those numbers, multiplied together, form part of your public key. When someone wants to send you a message, they use your public key to encrypt it. You’re the only person who knows the original prime numbers, so you’re the only person who can decrypt it. Until, that is, someone else builds a quantum computer that can use its spooky powers of parallel computation to derive the private key from the public one—not in millennia but in minutes. Then the whole system collapses.\nThe algorithm to do this already exists. In 1994, decades before anyone had built a real quantum computer, an AT&T Bell Labs researcher named Peter Shor designed the killer Q-Day app. Shor’s algorithm takes advantage of the fact that quantum computers run not on bits but on qubits. Rather than being locked in a state of 0 or 1, they can exist as both simultaneously—in superposition. When you run an operation on a handful of qubits in a given quantum state, you’re actually running that same operation on those same qubits in all their potential quantum states. With qubits, you’re not confined to trial and error. A quantum computer can explore all potential solutions simultaneously. You’re calculating probability distributions, waves of quantum feedback that pile onto each other and peak at the correct answer. With Shor’s algorithm, carefully designed to amplify certain mathematical patterns, that’s exactly what happens: Large numbers go in one end, factors come out the other.\nIn theory, at least. Qubits are incredibly difficult to build in real life, because the slightest environmental interference can nudge them out of the delicate state of superposition, where they balance like a spinning coin. But Shor’s algorithm ignited interest in the field, and by the 2010s, a number of projects were starting to make progress on building the first qubits. In 2016, perhaps sensing the nascent threat of Q-Day, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to develop quantum-proof encryption algorithms. These largely work by presenting quantum computers with complex multidimensional mazes, called structured lattices, that even they can’t navigate without directions.\nIn 2019, Google’s quantum lab in Santa Barbara claimed that it had achieved “quantum supremacy.” Its 53-qubit chip could complete in just 200 seconds a task that would have taken 100,000 conventional computers about 10,000 years. Google’s latest quantum processor, Willow, has 105 qubits. But to break encryption with Shor’s algorithm, a quantum computer will need thousands or even millions.\nThere are now hundreds of companies trying to build quantum computers using wildly different methods, all geared toward keeping qubits isolated from the environment and under control: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, molecular magnets, carbon nanospheres. While progress on hardware inches forward, computer scientists are refining quantum algorithms, trying to reduce the number of qubits required to run them. Each step brings Q-Day closer.\nThat’s bad news not just for RSA but also for a dizzying array of other systems that will be vulnerable on Q-Day. Security consultant Roger A. Grimes lists some of them in his book Cryptography Apocalypse: the DSA encryption used by many US government agencies until recently, the elliptic-curve cryptography used to secure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the VPNs that let political activists and porn aficionados browse the web in secrecy, the random number generators that power online casinos, the smartcards that let you tap through locked doors at work, the security on your home Wi-Fi network, the two-factor authentication you use to log in to your email account.\nExperts from one national security agency told me they break the resulting threats down into two broad areas: confidentiality and authentication. In other words, keeping secrets and controlling access to critical systems. Chris Demchak, a former US Army officer who is a professor of cybersecurity at the US Naval War College and spoke with me in a personal capacity, says that a Q-Day computer could let an adversary eavesdrop on classified military data in real time. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly where all of our submarines were,” Demchak says. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly what our satellites are looking at. And it would be very bad if they knew exactly how many missiles we had and their range.” The balance of geopolitical power in, say, the Taiwan Strait could quickly tilt.\nBeyond that real-time threat to confidentiality, there’s also the prospect of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. Hackers aligned with the Chinese state have reportedly been hoovering up encrypted data for years in hopes of one day having a quantum computer that can crack it. “They wolf up everything,” Demchak told me. (The US almost certainly does this too.) The question then becomes: How long will your sensitive data remain valuable? “There might be some needles in that haystack,” says Brian Mullins, the CEO of Mind Foundry, which helps companies implement quantum technology. Your current credit card details might be irrelevant in 10 years, but your fingerprint won’t be. A list of intelligence assets from the end of the Iraq War might seem useless until one of those assets becomes a prominent politician.\nThe threat to authentication may be even scarier. “Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption,” says Deborah Frincke, a computer scientist and national security expert at Sandia National Laboratories. “Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing some kind of command: to shut down a network, to influence the energy grid, to create financial disruption by shutting down the stock market.”\nThe exact level of Q-Day chaos will depend on who has access to the first cryptographically relevant quantum computers. If it’s the United States, there will be a “fierce debate” at the highest levels of government, Demchak believes, over whether to release it for scientific purposes or keep it secret and use it for intelligence. “If a private company gets there first, the US will buy it and the Chinese will try to hack it,” she claims. If it’s one of the US tech companies, the government could put it under the strict export controls that now apply to AI chips.\nMost nation-state attacks are on private companies—say, someone trying to break into a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin and steal plans for a next-generation fighter jet. But over time, as quantum computers become more widely available, the focus of the attacks could broaden. The likes of Microsoft and Amazon are already offering researchers access to their primitive quantum devices on the cloud—and big tech companies haven’t always been great at policing who uses their platforms. (The soldier who blew up a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early this year queried ChatGPT to help plan the attack.) You could have a bizarre scenario where a cybercriminal uses Amazon’s cloud quantum computing platform to break into Amazon Web Services.\nCybercriminals with access to a quantum computer could use it to go after the same targets more effectively, or take bigger swings: hijacking the SWIFT international payments system to redirect money transfers, or conducting corporate espionage to collect kompromat. The earliest quantum computers probably won’t be able to run Shor’s algorithm that quickly—they might only get one or two keys a day. But combining a quantum computer with an artificial intelligence that can map out an organization’s weakness and highlight which keys to decrypt to cause the most damage could yield devastating results.\nAnd then there’s Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is exquisitely vulnerable to Q-Day. Because each block in the Bitcoin blockchain captures the data from the previous block, Bitcoin cannot be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography, according to Kapil Dhiman, CEO of Quranium, a post-quantum blockchain security company. “The only solution to that seems to be a hard fork—give birth to a new chain and the old chain dies.”\nBut that would require a massive organizational effort. First, 51 percent of Bitcoin node operators would have to agree. Then everyone who holds bitcoin would have to manually move their funds from the old chain to the new one (including the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin developer who controls wallets containing around $100 billion of the cryptocurrency). If Q-Day happens before the hard fork, there’s nothing to stop bitcoin going to zero. “It’s like a time bomb,” says Dhiman.\nThat bomb going off will only be the beginning. When Q-Day becomes public knowledge, either via grim governmental address or cheery big-tech press release, the world will enter the post-quantum age. It will be an era defined by mistrust and panic—the end of digital security as we know it. “And then the scramble begins,” says Demchak.\nAll confidence in the confidentiality of our communications will collapse. Of course, it’s unlikely that everyone’s messages will actually be targeted, but the perception that you could be spied on at any time will change the way we live. And if NIST’s quantum-proof algorithms haven’t rolled out to your devices by that point, you face a real problem—because any attempts to install updates over the cloud will also be suspect. What if that download from Apple isn’t actually from Apple? Can you trust the instructions telling you to transfer your crypto to a new quantum-secure wallet?\nGrimes, the author of Cryptography Apocalypse, predicts enormous disruptions. We might have to revert to Cold War methods of transmitting sensitive data. (It’s rumored that after a major hack in 2011, one contractor purportedly asked its staff to stop using email for six weeks.) Fill a hard drive, lock it in a briefcase, put someone you trust on a plane with the payload handcuffed to their wrist. Or use one-time pads—books of pre-agreed codes to encrypt and decrypt messages. Quantum-secure, but not very scalable. Expect major industries—energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transportation—to slow to a crawl as companies with sensitive data switch to paper-based methods of doing business and scramble to hire expensive cryptography consultants. There will be a spike in inflation. Most people might just accept the inevitable: a post-privacy society in which any expectation of secrecy evaporates unless you’re talking to someone in person in a secluded area with your phones switched off. Big Quantum is Watching You.\nThe best-case scenario looks something like Y2K, where we have a collective panic, make the necessary upgrades to encryption, and by the time Q-Day rolls around it’s such an anticlimax that it becomes a joke. That outcome may still be possible. Last summer, NIST released its first set of post-quantum encryption standards. One of Joe Biden’s last acts as president was to sign an executive order changing the deadline for government agencies to implement NIST’s algorithms from 2035 to “as soon as practicable.”\nAlready, NIST’s post-quantum cryptography has been rolled out on messaging platforms such as Signal and iMessage. Sources told me that sensitive national security data is probably being locked up in ways that are quantum-secure. But while your email account can easily be Q-proofed over the internet (assuming the update doesn’t come from a quantum imposter!), other things can’t. Public bodies like the UK’s National Health Service are still using hardware and software from the 1990s. “Microsoft is not going to upgrade some of its oldest operating systems to be post-quantum secure,” says Ali El Kaafarani, the CEO of PQShield, a company that makes quantum-resistant hardware. Updates to physical infrastructure can take decades, and some of that infrastructure has vulnerable cryptography in places it can’t be changed: The energy grid, military hardware, and satellites could all be at risk.\nAnd there’s a balance to be struck. Rushing the transition risks introducing vulnerabilities that weren’t there before. “How do you make transitions slow enough that you can be confident and fast enough that you don’t dawdle?” asks Chris Ballance, CEO of Oxford Ionics, a quantum computing company. Some of those vulnerabilities might even be there by design: Memos leaked by Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator that was adopted by NIST in 2006. “Anytime anybody says you should use this particular algorithm and there’s a nation-state behind it, you’ve got to wonder whether there’s a vested interest,” says Rob Young, director of Lancaster University’s Quantum Technology Centre.\nThen again, several people I spoke to pointed out that any nation-state with the financial muscle and technical knowledge to build a quantum device that can run Shor’s algorithm could just as easily compromise the financial system, the energy grid, or an enemy’s security apparatus through conventional methods. Why invent a new computing paradigm when you can just bribe a janitor?\nLong before quantum technology is good enough to break encryption, it will be commercially and scientifically useful enough to tilt the global balance. As researchers solve the engineering challenge of isolating qubits from the environment, they’ll develop exquisitely sensitive quantum sensors that will be able to unmask stealth ships and map hidden bunkers, or give us new insight into the human body. Similarly, pharma companies of the future could use quantum to steal a rival’s inventions—or use it to dream up even better ones. So ultimately the best way to stave off Q-Day may be to share those benefits around: Take the better batteries, the miracle drugs, the far-sighted climate forecasting, and use them to build a quantum utopia of new materials and better lives for everyone.

This chart shows just how much the opportunity landscape has changed.\nAs AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or Replit have become more prominent, a large part of the job has become automated. In Salesforce's most recent earnings call, its CEO Marc Benioff said the company is seeing a \"30% productivity increase in engineering\" and won't \"hire any new engineers this year\" in the wake of those gains.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call in 2024 that over a quarter of the company's code is generated by AI before being checked by employees.\nA manager at Microsoft similarly shared that AI reduced 70% of the time he used to spend on coding, although he noted that his daily workload hasn't been reduced. That's because software engineers do more than just code. For newer entrants to the field, though, the opportunities are narrowing, and some have struggled to get the foundational skills needed to move up.\nSome recent software engineering grads have said they sent hundreds of job applications with minimal responses. That's led some to pursue a \"panic Master's\" degree to put off the hunt.\nIt's not all doom and gloom, though.\nAutomating coding tasks has increased the demand for developers to leverage their creativity and experience. Here's some of the advice from industry veterans and tech CEOs on how to improve your odds of getting a job in the field — and success stories from those who have done it."

            "full_content": "The quantum race is heating up.\nTech titans Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft each recently announced advancements in their prototype chips, tightening the race to develop a commercially useful quantum computer that could solve some of the universe's stickiest problems faster than a classical computer ever could.\nQuantum computing is a rapidly evolving — though still largely theoretical and deeply technical — field. But cracking it open could help discover new drugs, develop new chemical compounds, or break encryption methods, among other outcomes, researchers say.\nNaturally, each of the major players in Big Tech wants to be the one to take quantum computing mainstream.\n\"You're hearing a lot about it because this is a real tipping point,\" Oskar Painter, the director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services, told Business Insider in late February, following the company's announcement of its Ocelot chip.\nStick with us — here's where it gets complicated.\nWhere classical computing uses binary digits — 0s and 1s, called bits — to represent information, quantum computing relies on a foundation built from the quantum equivalent of bits, called qubits. When they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits allow quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.\nHowever, qubits are unstable, and their behavior is unpredictable. They require specific conditions, such as low light and extremely cold environments, to reduce errors. When the number of qubits is increased, the error rate goes up — making advancement in the field slowgoing.\nSmall-scale quantum computers already exist, but the race is on to scale them up and make them useful to a wider audience rather than just scientists.\nRecently, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have announced new prototype chips, and IBM has made strides in its existing quantum road map. Each company is using unique approaches to solve the error reduction and scalability problems that have long plagued the field and make useful quantum computing a reality.\nHere's how each approach stacks up.\nApproach to quantum: Topological qubits\nMost powerful quantum processor: Majorana 1\nIn February, Microsoft unveiled its new quantum chip, Majorana 1. The aim is for the chip to speed up the development of large-scale quantum computers from decades to years.\nMicrosoft said the chip uses a new state of matter to produce \"topological\" qubits that are less prone to errors and more stable. Essentially, this is a qubit based on a topological state of matter, which isn't a liquid, gas, or solid. As a result, these quantum particles could retain a \"memory\" of their position over time and move around each other. Information, therefore, could be stored across the whole qubit, so if any parts fail, the topological qubit could still hold key pieces of information and become more fault-resistant.\n\"Microsoft's progress is the hardest to get an idea about because it's very niche,\" said Tom Darras, founder of quantum computing startup Welinq. \"Even experts in the industry find it difficult to assess the quality of these results.\"\nQuantum experts agree that Microsoft still has many roadblocks to overcome, and its peer-reviewed Nature paper only demonstrates aspects of what its researchers have claimed to achieve — but some in the quantum ecosystem see it as a promising outcome.\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\nMost powerful quantum processor: Willow\nIn December, Google announced Willow, its newest quantum chip, which the company claims takes just five minutes to solve a problem that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10 septillion years.\nPerhaps more impressive was Google's breakthrough in how quantum computers scale. Historically, the more qubits that are added, and the more powerful the computer becomes, the more prone it is to errors. With Willow, Google's researchers said that adding more physical qubits to a quantum processor actually made it less error-prone, reversing the typical phenomenon.\nKnown as \"below threshold,\" the accomplishment marks a significant milestone by cracking a problem that has been around since the 1990s. In a study published in Nature, Google's researchers posit this breakthrough could finally offer a way to build a useful large-scale quantum computer. However, much of this is still theoretical, and now Google will need to prove it in practice.\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\nMost powerful quantum processor: Ocelot\nIn late February, Amazon Web Services announced its Ocelot chip, a prototype designed to advance the company's focus on cloud-based quantum computing.\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the Ocelot prototype demonstrated the potential to increase efficiency in quantum error correction by up to 90% compared to conventional approaches. The chip leverages a unique architecture that integrates cat qubit technology — named for the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment — and additional quantum error correction components that can be manufactured using processes borrowed from the electronics industry.\nTroy Nelson, a computer scientist and the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that Amazon's Ocelot chip is another building block that the industry will use to build a functioning quantum computer. However, its error rate needs to be substantially lowered, and its chips would require more qubit density before they're useful.\n\"There's lots of challenges ahead. What Amazon gained in error correction was a trade-off for the complexity and the sophistication of the control systems and the readouts from the chip,\" Nelson said. \"We're still in prototype days, and we still have multiple years to go, but they've made a great leap forward.\"\nApproach to quantum: Superconducting qubits\nMost powerful quantum processor: Condor\nIBM has been a quantum frontrunner for some time, with several different prototype chips and its development of Q System One,  the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, unveiled in January 2019, and has since been renamed IBM Quantum System One.\nIBM's Condor chip is the company's most powerful in terms of its number of qubits. However, since its development, IBM has focused its approach on the quality of its gate operations and making its newer quantum chips modular so multiple smaller, less error-prone chips can be combined to make more powerful quantum computing machines.\nCondor, the second-largest quantum processor ever made, was unveiled at the IBM Quantum Summit 2023 on December 4, 2023. At the same time, IBM debuted its Heron chip, a 133-qubit processor with a lower error rate. The latest Heron chip now has 156 qubits.\nRob Schoelkopf, cofounder and chief scientist of Quantum Circuits, told Business Insider that IBM has prioritized \"error mitigation\" over traditional error correction approaches. While IBM has so far been successful in what Schoelkopf calls \"brute force scaling\" with this approach, he said the methodology will need to be modified in the long run for efficiency.\nSankar Das Sarma, a theoretical condensed matter physicist at the University of Maryland, told Business Insider that the Amazon Web Services Ocelot chip, Google's Willow, and IBM's Condor use a \"more conventional\" superconducting approach to quantum development compared to other competitors.\nBy contrast, Microsoft's approach is based on topological Majorana zero modes, which also have a superconductor, but in \"a radically different manner,\" he said. If the Majorana 1 chip works correctly, Das Sarma added, it is protected topologically with minimal need for error correction, compared to claims from other tech companies that they have improved conventional error correction methods.\nStill, each company's approach is \"very different,\" Das Sarma said. \"It is premature to comment on who is ahead since the whole subject is basically in the initial development phase.\"\nBig Tech companies should be cautious about \"raising expectations when promoting results,\" said Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO of quantum computing startup Pasqal. \"Otherwise, you could create disillusionment.\"\nReymond's sentiment was echoed by IBM's VP of quantum adoption and business development, Scott Crowder, who told Business Insider he is concerned \"over-hype\" could lead people to discount quantum technology before its promise can be realized.\n\"We think we are on the cusp of demonstrating quantum advantage,\" said Crowder, referring to when a quantum computer outperforms classical machines. \"But the industry is still a few years from a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer.\""

I have almost zero interest in speaking to Gemini after our first awkward chat. The hitches, misunderstandings, and lag in any given AI “conversation” mean I’m always wasting time speaking when I could be texting instead. \nBut speaking to “Maya,” one of two voices from a new startup headed by the man who built Oculus VR and sold it to Facebook, is the first time I’ve been left wanting more. Like I could just talk to it, or at least play a genuinely fun game of testing its limits, like I did with Bing before Microsoft decided to tame down its unhinged persona.\nI don’t have to describe it to you: you can try it, and you can listen to my first conversation yourself just below. Fair warning: I am a nerd! Confronted with a new voice assistant, I will ask it to dream up a Dungeons & Dragons-esque adventure and quiz it about small Android phones. \nWhile I could absolutely still hear some chatbot nonsense coming through the cracks, I could easily interject – I asked Maya to inject “herself” into the adventure “she” was describing, and it did so without a hitch, immediately coming up with a Gnome engineer named Maya cobbling together deathtraps to protect my castle from incoming Orc invaders. Combined with the AI’s natural-sounding pauses, it felt more like a real conversation than anything I’ve had so far. Compared to my colleague Kylie Robinson’s conversation with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode last year, it feels like we’re somewhere much more compelling. \nThe company behind this is called Sesame, and it’s coming out of stealth today with an undisclosed amount of funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Spark Capital, and Matrix Partners —- all of which were big Oculus VR investors — with Oculus co-founder and former CEO Brendan Iribe, former Ubiquity6 CTO and co-founder Ankit Kumar, and former Meta Reality Labs research engineering director Ryan Brown in charge.\nAnd the company says it’s building AI glasses to go along with its new voice assistant, too, ones “designed to be worn all day, giving you high-quality audio and convenient access to your companion who can observe the world alongside you.” So far, it’s only sharing a few small images of what look like early prototypes:\nSesame has a mini white paper you can read on its website, describing the model and its dataset of around one million hours of “publicly available audio.” It says it plans to both open source its models, and expand from just English to over 20 languages “in the coming months.”\nIs this “crossing the uncanny valley of conversational voice,” as Sesame titles its blog post? Perhaps check it out and decide for yourself.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "OpenAI’s newest and largest model is being released as a research preview.\nOpenAI’s newest and largest model is being released as a research preview.\nby  Tom Warren and  Emma Roth\nOpenAI is launching GPT-4.5 today, its newest and largest AI language model. GPT-4.5 will be available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users to start. OpenAI is calling the release its “most knowledgeable model yet,” but initially warned that GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model and might not perform as well as o1 or o3-mini.\nGPT-4.5 will have better writing capabilities, improved world knowledge, and what OpenAI calls a “refined personality over previous models.” OpenAI says interacting with GPT 4.5 will feel more “natural,” adding that the model is better at recognizing patterns and drawing connections, making it ideal for writing, programming, and “solving practical problems.”\nHowever, OpenAI notes it won’t introduce enough new capabilities to be considered a frontier model. “GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model, but it is OpenAI’s largest LLM, improving on GPT-4’s computational efficiency by more than 10x,” OpenAI said in a document that leaked ahead of its announcement. “It does not introduce 7 net-new frontier capabilities compared to previous reasoning releases, and its performance is below that of o1, o3-mini, and deep research on most preparedness evaluations.” OpenAI has since removed this mention from an updated version of the document.\nIt was previously reported that OpenAI was using its o1 reasoning model, codenamed Strawberry, to train GPT-4.5 with synthetic data. OpenAI says it has trained GPT-4.5 “using new supervision techniques combined with traditional methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), similar to those used for GPT-4o.”\nDespite some of its limitations, GPT-4.5 hallucinates a lot less than GPT-4o, according to OpenAI, and slightly less than its o1 model. “We aligned GPT-4.5 to be a better collaborator, making conversations feel warmer, more intuitive, and emotionally nuanced,” Raphael Gontijo Lopes, a researcher at OpenAI, said during the company’s livestream. “To measure this, we asked human testers to evaluate it against GPT-4o, and GPT-4.5 outperformed on basically every category.”\nIn a post on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that GPT-4.5 is a “giant, expensive model” and that it “won’t crush benchmarks.”\nFollowing its launch for Pro users, OpenAI says GPT-4.5 will roll out to Plus and Team users next week and then to Enterprise and Edu users after that. It’s also available now in Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform, along with new models from Stability, Cohere, and Microsoft.\nWe revealed in Notepad last week that OpenAI was planning to launch GPT-4.5 by the end of February, and GPT-5 as soon as late May. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has referred to GPT-5 as a “system that integrates a lot of our technology,” and it will include OpenAI’s new o3 reasoning model, which the company teased during its 12 days of Christmas announcements in December.\nWhile OpenAI released o3-mini last month, OpenAI is only shipping o3 as part of its upcoming GPT-5 system. This aligns with OpenAI’s goal to combine its large language models to eventually create a more capable model that could be labeled as artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\nUpdate, February 27th: Noted that OpenAI changed its GPT-4.5 system card and added information from Sam Altman.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "You can still choose how often you see AI-assisted answers, which now incorporate results from the web.\nYou can still choose how often you see AI-assisted answers, which now incorporate results from the web.\nDuckDuckGo has big plans for embedding AI into its search engine. The privacy-focused company just announced that its AI-generated answers, which appear for certain queries on its search engine, have exited beta and now source information from across the web — not just Wikipedia. It will soon integrate web search within its AI chatbot, which has also exited beta.\nDuckDuckGo first launched AI-assisted answers — originally called DuckAssist — in 2023. The feature is billed as a less obnoxious version of tools like Google’s AI Overviews, designed to offer more concise responses and let you adjust how often you see them, including turning the responses off entirely. If you have DuckDuckGo’s AI-generated answers set to “often,” you’ll still only see them around 20 percent of the time, though the company plans on increasing the frequency eventually.\n“We’d like to raise that over time,” Gabriel Weinberg, the CEO and founder of DuckDuckGo, told The Verge. “That’s another major area that we’re working on … We want to kind of stay conservative with it. We don’t want to put it in front of people if we don’t think it’s right.”\nSome of DuckDuckGo’s AI-assisted answers bring up a box for follow-up questions, redirecting you to a conversation with its Duck.ai chatbot. As is the case with its AI-assisted answers, you don’t need an account to use Duck.ai, and it comes with the same emphasis on privacy. It lets you toggle between GPT-4o mini, o3-mini, Llama 3.3, Mistral Small 3, and Claude 3 Haiku, with the advantage being that you can interact with each model anonymously by hiding your IP address. DuckDuckGo also has agreements with the AI company behind each model to ensure your data isn’t used for training.\nDuck.ai also rolled out a feature called Recent Chats, which stores your previous conversations locally on your device rather than on DuckDuckGo’s servers. Though Duck.ai is also leaving beta, that doesn’t mean the flow of new features will stop.\nIn the next few weeks, Duck.ai will add support for web search, which should enhance its ability to respond to questions. The company is also working on adding voice interaction on iPhone and Android, along with the ability to upload images and ask questions about them. Weinberg said that while Duck.ai will always remain free, the company is considering including access to more advanced AI models with its $9.99 per month subscription.\nDuckDuckGo isn’t going to join OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and maybe even Meta in creating a separate app for its AI chatbot, however. “We think the end state is that really the ultimate app mixes all these things,” Weinberg said. “We think some queries are better to start with chat, some are better to start with search. A lot of them, you could start with either. Then sometimes you want to flow between. And if you’re flowing between, kind of fluidly like that, it’s a better experience to have it in one app.”\nYou can try out DuckDuckGo’s chatbot on the Duck.ai website or the DuckDuckGo browser, as well as find AI-assisted answers in the DuckDuckGo search engine.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "An emoji buddy for my laptop? I’m in.\nAn emoji buddy for my laptop? I’m in.\nby  Antonio G. Di Benedetto\nLenovo is throwing ideas at the wall with new modular accessories for the magnetic Magic Bay connector of its ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 laptop. At Mobile World Congress 2025, the company announced four different proof-of-concept add-ons that may or may not ever be released, and they’re as cool as they are quirky:\nThere aren’t many details on the concepts yet, though the 2nd Display and Dual Display are the most straightforward. They’re meant for people who want a mobile multimonitor setup that doesn’t require a secondary device to plug in or keep charged. The 2nd Display is like attaching an 8-inch iPad Mini to your laptop, with a vertical orientation that could be great for social feeds and communication apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It has a panel with a 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution and 60Hz, which is plenty of resolution for a small screen.\nThe Dual Display Concept takes the ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 and turns it into a triple-monitor setup. The two attachable displays are each 13.3 inches with 2880 x 1920-pixel resolution and 120Hz refresh. They weigh a hefty 2.62 pounds, nearly as heavy as carrying a 13-inch MacBook Air with your ThinkBook. I saw this setup and the 2nd Display Concept in an early in-person preview, and while having a triple-monitor laptop seemed awesome, it was also just a lot. The Dual Display Concept was cumbersome to set up, fold down, and put away. On the other hand, the 2nd Display was easy to work with and felt like a no-brainer if it ever comes to market.\nAs for the pair of Tiko concepts, I didn’t get to see them but they’re such different ideas sharing the same name. Lenovo doesn’t have many details yet on the Tiko Pro horizontal screen attachment, but having an additional display for widgets seems nifty. I bet its teleprompter function would sell many units on that sole feature.\nBut the Tiko emoji friend looks like an absolute charmer. It’s a circular screen to display what Lenovo calls “a compact AI emotional interaction companion” that “helps users stay informed and engaged throughout their workday.” I’m all about emojis, and this is an emoji buddy you can attach to your laptop.\nIt looks similar to the aptly named AI Buddy that Lenovo showed at its recent Tech World conference, which was designed for a desktop. The Buddy was a voice-enabled AI chatbot that could also take actions on your computer for you. The Tiko Pro, at least based on Lenovo’s early indications, seems more like a lighthearted plaything you can casually interact with. For example, you can make a heart hand gesture at it and it’ll react with hearts, and you can put it in a cute cat case — complete with a tail!\nI don’t know why the business-focused ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 is simultaneously the platform for multimonitor features for power users and a digital equivalent to an emotional support animal, but I’m here for it regardless. Let’s see if any of these concepts survive the cutting room floor.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "You can now pay for two years of Preferred Care coverage upfront. \n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\nGoogle is changing its insurance partner for Preferred Care plans as of today, Feb. 24, and is adding a new payment option as part of the move. The company updated its official support page with the new insurance provider, as well as the one-time payment option that covers a Pixel phone, tablet, or watch for two years (via Android Authority). Previously, all Pixel devices had to be protected with Preferred Care via a subscription.\nGoogle's Preferred Care plans are a means of insuring a Pixel or Fitbit device, just like AppleCare Plus or Samsung Care. Starting today, there are two different ways of purchasing a Preferred Care plan. You can either insure the device for two years with a one-time payment, or choose a monthly subscription for up to 60 months of total coverage. In the event your screen is cracked, you'll pay $29 for a repair or up to $129 for a replacement.\nThe new offering coincides with a notice that Google changed its insurance provider for Preferred Care: \"If your device is shipped on or after February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Asurion Warranty Protection Services, LLC, or one of its affiliates,\" the company explains in the support document. \"If your device is shipped prior to February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Assurant.\"\nThe only apparent consumer-facing change as part of the switch is the addition of the one-time payment option. Like the monthly plan, you can either add a plan during checkout at the Google Store or within 30 days of your purchase.\nThe prices for the two-year Preferred Care plans are as follows:\nThe above prices offer buyers a slight discount on Preferred Care compared to the cost of subscribing monthly for two years. Of course, the downside is that you can't insure your Pixel device with Preferred Care beyond 24 months if you use the upfront option.\nGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android\nBrady is a tech journalist for Android Central, with a focus on news, phones, tablets, audio, wearables, and software.

While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.\nFor its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the Pixel 8a. It also arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model (4700mAh). The device gets Android 15 out of the box, the new Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. It comes with an extended battery life of up to 30 hours, faster charging, and two new colorways: Iris and Peony. Starting at $499, it has a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera.\nBut what about Pre-orders, you ask? Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a. Google said in an email that the device will be going on sale sometime in April without an exact date of sale. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a \"component quality issue\" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: \"We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices.\"\nGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android\nAlphabet, Google's parent company, is under investigation by the EU Commission. It posted its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies so that they don't favor their products over other players on the market— leveling the playing field for other tech companies.\nThe report claimed two things: First, Google Search showed results favoring Google at the top of the results page rather than similar services offered by third parties. Second, app developers who contribute to the Google Play Store should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.\nResponding to this report, Google stated in a blog post that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are \"having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers.\" However the company will continue to have discussions with the EU to come to a middle ground.\nCan we just say, better late than never? One UI 7 update of Galaxy devices finally has a launch date. Samsung announced this week that the official rollout for the stable version of the OS will arrive as early as April 7—for those in the company's home ground, Korea, at least. Folks in the U.S. have to wait for another three days post-launch, aka April 10, to be able to see the update pop up on their devices.\nAccording to the announcement post, the first set of devices that will be lucky enough to experience the OS are the Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. While other eligible devices will see a gradual rollout post-launch \"in the coming weeks.\"\nVerizon announced it is bringing satellite texting to any device via \"select\" Android phones. Verizon will bring this feature to its U.S.-based customers first. The company states users can \"send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks.\"\nHowever, this feature won't show up on every Android phone. Users with a Samsung Galaxy S25 or Google Pixel 9 series phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting. Verizon's EVP & president of Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, \"This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are.\"\nThe company has started working on incorporating this feature as we speak. However, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.\nPebbleOS watches have made a comeback and how! Pebble's founder, Eric Migicovsky, in a new blog post announced the arrival of two new smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, \"Core Devices.\" Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with \"thousands of your beloved Pebble apps.\"\nTime 2 is a 1.5-inch e-paper display watch that will deliver \"less glare and reflections\" than its older watches. It has a 53% larger display with 88% more pixels, the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices had given the watch an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker. The Time 2 is available for pre-orders for $225.\nThe second watch is the Core 2 Duo, which the company says is identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. This smartwatch features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display with a lightweight polycarbonate frame and three physical buttons. Like Time 2, Core Devices states it is \"targeting\" an IPX8 water-resistant rating. For $149, it includes a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.\nThose are some of the biggest stories from this week.

            "full_content": "A principios del pasado mes de febrero se hizo público el interés del grupo inversor japonés SoftBank en la adquisición del diseñador de chips estadounidense Ampere Computing LLC. Esta última compañía está especializada en el desarrollo de procesadores para servidores, lo que puso ya en aquel momento sobre la mesa la intención de SoftBank de ampliar su negocio en los grandes centros de datos. Tenía sentido en un contexto en el que al auge de la inteligencia artificial (IA) está propiciando que estas instalaciones se multipliquen a toda velocidad.\nApenas un mes y medio después ese movimiento estratégico se ha consolidado. Según la propia Ampere, SoftBank acaba de cerrar su compra. Pagará 6.500 millones de dólares por esta compañía y tendrá una carta más en el presumiblemente próspero negocio de los centros de datos. Este grupo inversor es el propietario de ARM desde 2016; a principios del pasado mes de octubre invirtió 500 millones de dólares en OpenAI; y, además, es una de las compañías que lideran el programa Stargate con el que EEUU persigue sostener su dominio de la IA.\nLas grandes compañías de tecnología que están involucradas en el despliegue de la IA están afrontando inversiones multimillonarias para desarrollar su infraestructura de centros de datos. Microsoft ha confirmado que se gastará 80.000 millones de dólares durante el ejercicio fiscal de 2025. Y Google, 75.000 millones. Por otro lado, el presupuesto del programa Stargate que he mencionado unas líneas más arriba asciende a nada menos que 500.000 millones de dólares. Esta es la tarta de la que espera poder apoderarse SoftBank. Al menos de una buena porción.\nLos chips AmpereOne alcanzarán los 256 núcleos durante 2025 y presumiblemente tendrán una eficiencia energética muy competitiva\nNo obstante, para lograrlo las empresas que controla, o controlará a corto plazo, como Ampere, cuyos procesadores están implementados sobre la tecnología de ARM, tendrán que competir con NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Google o Amazon. En cualquier caso, los chips AmpereOne, que están siendo fabricados por TSMC en su nodo de 3 nm, alcanzarán los 256 núcleos durante 2025 y presumiblemente tendrán una eficiencia energética muy competitiva. Estas son sus grandes bazas frente a las propuestas de la competencia.\nLa coyuntura actual está desencadenando algo que merece la pena que no pasemos por alto. Tal y como ha observado Dan O'Brien, el presidente de la consultora estadounidense Futurum, las compañías de tecnología están forjando alianzas estratégicas con el propósito de moldear la industria a su medida y maximizar el rendimiento económico de sus inversiones. Como hemos visto, SoftBank es la propietaria de ARM. Por otro lado, Oracle tiene una participación muy significativa en Ampere, que pronto pertenecerá a SoftBank, y que es cliente de ARM.\nAdemás, todas las compañías en las que acabamos de reparar, SoftBank, ARM, Oracle y OpenAI, participan en el despliegue de la infraestructura que requiere el programa Stargate. En cualquier caso, esta red de dependencias no acaba aquí. Como hemos visto, SoftBank es un inversor importante de OpenAI, y esta última compañía es socia de Oracle y está intentando desarrollar sus propios chips para IA.\nPor último, para rizar aún más el rizo, persisten los rumores que defienden que Oracle está interesada en comprar TikTok, una empresa que pertenece a la compañía china ByteDance. SoftBank también tiene una participación importante en esta última. Como sostiene O'Brien en su tuit \"todo está conectado [...] Es fascinante ver cómo los titanes de la tecnología moldean la industria\".\nImagen | Ampere Computing LLC\nMás información | Ampere Computing LLC\nEn Xataka | La GPU B300 es la nueva bestia de NVIDIA para IA.

            "full_content": "Home > Anti-Piracy > DMCA > \n\n\n \n                    A single DMCA anti-circumvention notice, sent by Nintendo on the one-year anniversary of its 2024 lawsuit against Yuzu, showed just how much things can change in a year. Targeting nine repos linked to Switch emulator Ryujinx, the domino effect led to the removal of 4,238 repos. Elsewhere, the distilled components of Yuzu's demise can be found in recent takedown notices\n        \n\n\n\n\nLate September 2024, the developer of Switch emulator Ryujinx announced an end to the project. Launched by ‘gdkchan’ in 2017, Ryujinx enjoyed years of success only to succumb to the same pressure that had claimed another emulator, Yuzu, just a few months earlier.\nWithin a seemingly flawless design that could’ve been crafted by Shigeru Miyamoto himself, Nintendo filed an arguably perfect lawsuit against Yuzu on February 26, 2024. A previously unknown business entity behind Yuzu quickly acknowledged its veracity, and a settlement was formally announced to the court exactly a week later, March 4, 2024.\nSpecific conduct detailed in the lawsuit laid the foundations for Yuzu’s swift demise and provided a blueprint for similar Nintendo victories moving forward. With the market leader defeated so easily, it seemed that only the brave or very rich would gamble on a different outcome.\nIn September, just months after the filing of the original lawsuit against Yuzu on February 26, Nintendo “offered an agreement” to gdkchan. Once accepted, that ended his involvement in the Ryujinx project.\nDuring November 2024, domains including ryujinx.org and ryujinx.blog were transferred to Nintendo ownership. They join other domains previously secured by Nintendo for permanent safekeeping, including jailbreakmyswitch.com and donkeykong.porn.\nA pair of Nintendo DMCA notices sent to GitHub last week coincided with the one-year anniversary of the Yuzu lawsuit. Dated February 26, they contained requests to remove repos that had been helping to keep the open source Ryujinx emulator alive. Before taking action, GitHub contacted the nine repositories listed in the first notice and gave their owners an opportunity to make changes to avoid being taken down.\nUltimately, deletion couldn’t be avoided, not for the nine repos named in the notice, or for more than 4,200 others in the same network.\n\n\n\n\n“Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 4,238 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository,” GitHub reports.\nThe second Nintendo notice also targeted Ryujinx repos; just three this time, but once again the notice punched above its weight. After giving repo owners a chance to address Nintendo’s complaint, GitHub processed the notice against a network of 113 repositories.\nRemoving so many repos at once would’ve likely been less straightforward a year ago. The law today stands completely unchanged but the effect of the Yuzu lawsuit and settlement suggests that if perceptions have shifted, any change strongly favors Nintendo.\nNintendo “owns or exclusively controls” numerous copyrights in games that are protected from unlawful access and copying by so-called ‘technological protection measures’ (TPM). For example, Switch games are encrypted, so before they can be played, decryption takes place using Nintendo keys, also known as ‘prod keys’. \nCircumventing TPMs that “effectively control access” to copyrighted works is outlawed under the DMCA. In this context, anyone doing so without obtaining permission from Nintendo commits an offense under the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions.\nYuzu lawsuit allegations distilled in a takedown notice\n\n\n\n\nThe text of the Nintendo notice notes that the Ryujinx emulator is primarily designed to play illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games and does so by illegally circumventing Nintendo’s TPMs. Since that can only be achieved through use of unauthorized copies of Nintendo prod keys, that means Ryujinx is primarily designed to unlawfully circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under the DMCA. \nDistribution of Ryujinx, therefore, constitutes unlawful trafficking in a technology that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure, contrary to 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1) and (2).\nNintendo goes on to reference the final judgment in Nintendo of America Inc. v. Tropic Haze LLC, highlighting the finding that “the distribution of software which primarily decrypts Nintendo Switch games without authorization, violates the DMCA’s anti-trafficking provisions.”\nGitHub’s ‘developer first’ policy takes DMCA takedown notices seriously while arguably fixing a potential avenue of abuse. DMCA anti-circumvention notices differ from regular notices due to the absence of a mechanism to dispute the claim via a counternotice. By granting a right of reply, GitHub ensures that bogus claims can’t be used for censorship purposes. Google also makes best efforts to weed out potential abuse but in general, URLs targeted by anti-circumvention notices are unlikely to see the light of day again.\nHaving reviewed many recent Nintendo anti-circumvention notices (1,2), there are no signs of any questionable takedowns. Most use a format historically used to remove URLs offering SX OS, SX Pro, SX Core and SX Lite devices, with Nintendo using exactly the same terms to describe these obvious piracy devices as it does to describe the emulators.\nThe URLs listed below promote, offer for sale directly or direct visitors to resellers of, circumvention software and devices called the SX OS, SX Pro, SX Core and SX Lite, among others. The SX OS, SX Pro, SX Core and SX Lite are designed to bypass technological protection measures in the Nintendo Switch video game system and allows users to play unauthorized copies of Nintendo’s video game files that are offered unlawfully via the Internet. circumvention mechanism: Nintendo’s technological protection measures (“TPMs”) ensure that only official copies of its game software can be played on Nintendo’s video game systems. The circumvention devices, products or components offered at the reported links bypass Nintendo’s TPMs so that users can play unauthorized copies of Nintendo’s game files that are offered unlawfully via the Internet.\nNintendo now uses the same format to target SX devices, prod keys, sig patches and emulators in the same notice (1). \nEssentially, the Yuzu lawsuit didn’t change a thing under law but may have succeeded in shaping perceptions of the emulation landscape. Whether that will reduce Switch 2 piracy will remain to be seen.\nSubmit a correction or tip.\nBreaking news stories\nSocial media followers\n\nCopyright\n            \n            ·                                    Privacy Policy\n            \n            ·                                    VPN Providers\n            \n            ·                                    About TorrentFreak"

That seemed to be the message Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)) co-founder Sergey Brin told employees when urging them to be in the office “at least” every weekday.\nIn a Feb. 26 memo to employees who work on Gemini, Google's lineup of AI models and apps, viewed by the New York Times, Brin wrote, “I recommend being in the office at least every weekday, adding that that “60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity.”\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nMany don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move\nGoogle’s current return-to-work policy mandates that employees work in the office at least three days a week. Brin’s message underscores the intense competition between tech giants to achieve artificial general intelligence when machines match or become smarter than humans.\n“Competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to A.G.I. is afoot,” Brin wrote. “I think we have all the ingredients to win this race, but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts.”\nIt’s not only employees who are putting in the office hours. Multi-billionaires, too, are rolling up their sleeves to keep their companies ahead of the AI curve. Brin returned to Google after the launch of Chat GPT, aware, according to the Times, that his company had lost ground in the AI footrace. Brin's main focus since his return has been working with the company's AI specialists in their DeepMind division.\nIn marshaling workers to the cause, Brin wrote: “A number of folks work less than 60 hours and a small number put in the bare minimum to get by.This last group is not only unproductive but also can be highly demoralizing to everyone else.”\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\nJeff Bezos, who stepped down as CEO of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in July 2021, but remained as chairman, is back in the office, trying to help the company he founded stay in the AI arms race.\nBezos told the NY Times DealBook conference on Dec. 4 that 95% of his time at Amazon is spent focusing on AI within the company, which he said is building 1,000 AI applications internally.\nAccording to CEO Today, Mark Zuckerberg, who works between 50 and 60 hours per week in the office at Meta (NASDAQ:META), is also determined to wrestle back ground from ChatGPT and compete with Google by releasing a standalone Meta AI app to do just that.\n“This is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant,” Zuckerberg told analysts during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January.”\nSee Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\nAt chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has helped to facilitate the AI boom, employees often work seven days a week and sometimes until 2 a.m., according to a report in Bloomberg, emulating the workaholic habits of CEO Jensen Huang and fueled by the generous pay the company offers.\n“I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. I work seven days a week,” Huang told Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, on the “20VC” podcast. “When I’m not working, I’m thinking about working, and when I’m working, I’m working. I sit through movies, but I don’t remember them because I’m thinking about work,” he said.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nThis article Google Co-Founder Says Employees Should Be In The Office \"At Least\" Every Weekday As Competition In The AI Arms Race Intensifies originally appeared on Benzinga.com\nSign in to access your portfolio"

After all, there are numerous layers of complexity that go into the serving of webpages, with multiple companies, agencies, and organizations each playing a role.\nThat’s why when something does catch our attention, it’s important that various entities work together to explore the cause and, more importantly, try to identify whether it’s a malicious actor at work, a glitch in the process, or maybe even something entirely intentional.\nThat’s what occurred last year when Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) staff and contractors were analysing names in Domain Name System (DNS) queries seen at the ICANN Managed Root Server, and the analysis program ran out of memory for one of their data files. After some investigating, they found the cause to be a very large number of mysterious queries for unique names including:\nWhile these were queries for names in existing Top-Level Domains (TLDs), the first label consisted of 12 or 13 random looking characters. After ICANN shared its discovery with the other root server operators, Verisign took a closer look to help understand the situation.\nOne of the first things we noticed was that all these mysterious queries were name server (NS) type and came from one Autonomous System (AS) network, AS 15169, assigned to Google LLC. Additionally, we confirmed that it was occurring consistently for numerous TLDs, as per Figure 1.\nAlthough this phenomenon was newly uncovered, analysis of historical data (Figure 2) showed these traffic patterns began in late 2019.\nPerhaps the most interesting discovery was that these specific query names were not also seen at the .com and .net name servers operated by Verisign. The data in Figure 3 shows the fraction of queried names that appear at A-root and J-root and also appear on the .com and .net name servers. For second-level labels of 12 and 13 characters, this fraction was essentially zero. The graphs also show that there appear to be queries for names with second-level label lengths of 10 and 11 characters, which are also absent from the TLD data.\nThe final mysterious aspect of this traffic is that it deviated from our normal expectation of caching. Remember that these are queries to a root name server, which return a referral to the delegated name servers for a TLD. For example, when a root name server receives a query for yyif0aijr21gn.com, the response is a list of name servers that are authoritative for the .com zone. The records in this response had a Time to Live (TTL) of two days, meaning that the recursive name server can cache and reuse this data for that amount of time.\nHowever, in this traffic (Figure 4), we saw queries for .com domain names from AS 15169 at the rate of about 30 million per day. It is well known that the Google Public DNS has thousands of backend servers and limits TTLs to a maximum of six hours. Assuming 4,000 backend servers each cached a .com referral for six hours, we might expect about 16,000 queries over 24 hours. The observed count is about 2,000 times higher by this back-of-the-envelope calculation.\nFrom our initial analysis, it was unclear if these queries represented legitimate end user activity, though we were confident that source IP address spoofing was not involved. However, since the query names shared some similarities to those used by botnets, we could not rule out malicious activity.\nWe presented these findings last year at the DNS-OARC 35a virtual meeting. In the meeting chat room after the presentation, a participant proposed the missing piece of this puzzle: There is a Google webpage describing its public DNS service that talks about prepending nonce (meaning random) labels for cache misses increasing entropy. In what came to be known as ‘the Kaminsky Attack’, an attacker can cause a recursive name server to emit queries for names chosen by the attacker. Prepending a nonce label adds unpredictability to the queries, making it very difficult to spoof a response. Note that nonce prepending only works for queries where the reply is a referral.\nIn addition, Google DNS has implemented a form of query name minimization (see RFC 7816 and RFC 9156). As such, if a user requests the IP address of www.example.com and Google DNS decides this warrants a query to a root name server, it takes the name, strips all labels except for the TLD and then prepends a nonce string, resulting in something like u5vmt7xanb6rf.com. A root server’s response to that query is identical to one using the original query name.\nNow, we could explain nearly all the mysterious aspects of this query traffic from Google. We saw random second-level labels because of the nonce strings that are designed to prevent spoofing. The 12- and 13-character-long labels were most likely the result of converting a 64-bit random value into an unpadded ASCII label with encoding similar to Base32. We didn’t observe the same queries at TLD name servers because of both the nonce prepending and query name minimization. The query type is always NS because of query name minimization.\nWith that said, there was still one aspect that eludes explanation — the high query rate (2000x for .com) and apparent lack of caching. And so, this aspect of the mystery continues.\nEven though we haven’t fully closed the book on this case, one thing is certain — without the community’s teamwork to put the pieces of the puzzle together, explanations for this strange traffic may have remained unknown today.\nThe case of the mysterious DNS root query traffic is a perfect example of the collaboration that’s required to navigate today’s ever-changing cyber environment. We’re grateful and humbled to be part of such a dedicated community that is intent on ensuring the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet, and we look forward to more productive teamwork in the future.\nDuane Wessels is a Fellow at Verisign, with a focus on DNSSEC projects and root zone operations.\nThe views expressed by the authors of this blog are their own\n                                and do not necessarily reflect the views of APNIC.

            "full_content": "Home > Anti-Piracy > Site Blocking > \n\n\n \n                    A renewed attempt to introduce site blocking in the U.S. emerged in late January when U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D) introduced the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act. The FADPA bill received the MPA's full support, and it now transpires that similar legislation is being prepared by U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa (R). A recent meeting to discuss the 'American Copyright Protection Act' was attended by Disney, Paramount, and Amazon, plus Google, YouTube, and Verizon.\n        \nOver 12 years in the making, the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act was introduced by Rep. Zoe Lofgren  (D-CA) late last month. \nCarefully crafted to avoid the controversies of the failed SOPA bill in 2012, FADPA’s central aim is to provide a framework to facilitate mass site-blocking measures in the United States, targeting foreign pirate sites. Importantly, FADPA seeks legal amendments to shield subjected ISPs from liability.\nAfter rightsholders in Italy and more recently France obtained injunctions against DNS resolvers operated by Cloudflare, Google, and OpenDNS, the FADPA bill seeks similar measures right from the start. DNS resolvers operated by companies with less than $100m in annual revenue are excluded, however. \nThe self-imposed restrictions on DNS resolvers cited in the FADPA bill, do not mean that the resulting measures are limited in scope. The so-called ‘dynamic’ injunctions envisioned by FADPA cannot exist within an inflexible legal framework, meaning that space for adjustment will become evident as the process moves forward. \nThe current climate may offer the best opportunity in years to push FADPA over the line. Google’s traditional opposition to blocking proposals is well known, but activity in more recent years suggests a non-front line position for the search giant, that’s if there’s any opposition at all. \nThe potential for a change in dynamics becomes more interesting on the back of news that FADPA will soon find itself joined by another bill with similar site-blocking aims. After waiting 12 years for a new bill to arrive, the prospect of weighing two bills against each other comes at a time when rightsholders are already showing signs of support for both.\nLess specific in its title but just as focused as its FADPA rival in tackling foreign pirate sites, details of the American Copyright Protection Act emerged in The Ankler. \nThe publication introduces ACPA architect U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa (R) as “New Hollywood Friend.” Considering the congressman’s focus in ACPA is “judicial blocking” of foreign sites, this will further amplify the need for action.\nDuring a roundtable meeting late January at the Millennium Biltmore in Los Angeles, key supporters of FADPA were in attendance to discuss ACPA and the threat posed by overseas pirate sites. Whether site blocking (‘judicial blocking’ in ACPA parlance) can effectively deal with surging levels of piracy will have been answered affirmatively by at least three of the companies in attendance. \nAs members of the MPA, a driving force behind many of the site blocking schemes operating in the world today, Amazon, Disney, and Paramount are proponents of site blocking by default. In practical terms, the United States represents the final frontier, or at least the last major site blocking hurdle.\nAlso in attendance during the off-the-record meeting were executives from Google and YouTube. Under common ownership, any official position on site-blocking measures hasn’t been raised in public for years. Traditionally an opponent of blocking, Google directly or indirectly played a key role in the failure of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) bill in 2012. \nTo a background of increased business scrutiny in both the United States and Europe, signs that Google may be less entrenched includes the deindexing of pirate sites from search results. Google only removes sites previously deemed infringing by competent courts, but no longer requires to be a named party itself. A copy of a court order and a list of sites is now enough for Google to take voluntary action, in Europe, Brazil, India, Australia and beyond.\nYouTube’s position on foreign pirate sites and site-blocking in general, most likely aligns with that of Google. Given the staggering volume of traffic they account for worldwide, available for free at the point of consumption, describing pirate sites as competitors might not be too much of a stretch. \nOf more interest is the presence of a major ISP at the meeting last month.\nWhen FADPA was introduced in January, the MPA and affiliated groups voiced support for the bill in no uncertain terms. Yet without the support and cooperation of other key players, a coordinated site blocking program in the U.S. would never reach its full potential and may even struggle to get off the ground. \nFor reasons that are still unclear, to our knowledge no major ISPs in the United States have even acknowledged the existence of the bill, let alone stated their official positions.\nRegardless of who put them in place, when site blocking schemes irritate or confuse the public, ISPs become the logical focus of consumer complaints. Attitudes to blocking in Europe have softened over time but in the United States, brand image risk could increase along with customer churn. Yet despite being responsible for the blocks, rightsholders remain distant throughout.\nAs far as we’re able to determine, Verizon was the sole telecoms company at the roundtable meeting, but its official position on site-blocking in this context is unknown. Like most major ISPs, Verizon may conclude that less piracy will have a positive effect on its own bottom line, mostly thanks to improved sales of Fios TV subscriptions. \nWho represents the interests of consumers and the wider public in these discussions is unknown. Ultimately they’ll have to deal with any consequences and also pick up the bill, so perhaps a little more transparency will be considered later in the year.\nThe Consumer Technology Association did participate in the roundtable. The trade group says it acts as “a voice that defends your business from harmful legislation”. To what degree that applies here may differ from member to member.\nThe group’s non-exhaustive member list below includes Amazon, Disney, Google, Verizon, and a few other familiar names, many of which are currently engaged in site-blocking in other parts of the world, either directly or through subsidiaries.\nNetflix, Nvidia, Adobe, Dell, AMD, Discovery, Qualcomm Inc, Alphabet (Google LLC), DISH Network, Amazon, Facebook, Fox Corp, Apple, AT&T, General Motors, Best Buy, HP, Walmart, Comcast, IBM, Intel, Disney, JP Morgan\nSubmit a correction or tip.\nBreaking news stories\nSocial media followers\n\nCopyright\n            \n            ·                                    Privacy Policy\n            \n            ·                                    VPN Providers\n            \n            ·                                    About TorrentFreak"

            "full_content": "Thereâs just something about building your own PC. Whether itâs your very first build or your umpteenth, itâs just magic. It can also be a time-consuming, nerve-racking process. (Did you make sure youâre grounded before you touch anything??) And for those who donât have the time or patience to build a rig, a prebuilt one can be just as good. Take the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme, a Best Buy exclusive that packs a bunch of power into an RGB-lit mid-tower that can do it all: gaming, content creation, and productivity, and it looks good doing it.\nPriced at under $3,000, the Gamer Supreme pairs a mighty AMD Ryzen 7 processor with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080. You know, that one GPU that’s currently flying off the shelves. As one of the higher-end cards in Nvidiaâs new 50-series lineup, this desktop isnât afraid to exert its dominance. Itâs got just enough flash, and if youâre feeling froggy later down the line, itâs not too hard to swap out parts.\nThe CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme is a prime candidate for gamers looking for convenience and power.\nCyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme PC\nThe CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme PC is a prebuilt beauty that combines power and convenience\nThe Gamer Supreme is a Best Buy exclusive. It costs $2,630 and has a 4.7-GHz AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU with 32GB of DDR5 5600MHz SDRAM, 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, integrated AMD Radeon GPU, and a discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU with 16GB of VRAM. The mid-tower also has a trio of Montech fans preinstalled with CyberPowerPCâs Bitspower Infinity 360-millimeter AIO Liquid CPU Cooling. And for the PSU, youâveÂ got a 1,000W ATX 3.0 power supply.\nHowever, if thatâs not enough power for you, CyberPowerPC’s website lets you configure something that fits your discerning taste.\nIn terms of design, the Supreme looks like many other prebuilt cases on the market. The mid-tower is a sturdy mix of aluminum, tempered glass, wires, and RGB lighting. While it doesnât have any funky, out-of-this-world design, the case will still turn its fair share of heads. The front and left side panels are tempered glass, while the bottom, rear, top, and undercarriage are black anodized aluminum.\nThe top metal plate is attached magnetically and can be easily removed via the gray fabric lanyard in the back. It provides easy access to the fans at the top of the system. Both sides of the desktop can be removed. The metal side needs the screws in the back removed to slide it off, while a pair of divots at the top of Supreme will help you detach the glass panel. Itâs something youâll have to do to remove the protective foam packaged inside the case to protect the graphics card.\nAfter the foam is removed and the Supreme is powered on, take a minute to appreciate the RGB-lit fans inside the system and the rainbow strip along the front and left side of the case. The lighting draws your eye to the MSI Nvidia RTX 5080 graphics card and the rainbow-hued compartment encasing the AMD Ryzen CPU on the motherboard. The wires connected to the CPU and GPU are neatly arranged. That clean cable management continues on the desktopâs right side underneath the metal panel. I appreciate that it’d be a pretty easy process if I wanted to upgrade or swap out components.\nAs far as ports, the Supreme has a fair amount. In the front, thereâs a pair of USB-A ports, a USB-C 3.1 port, and a pair of audio jacks with the power button in the center. A quick look in the back reveals the motherlode. There are six USB-A ports in the back of various speeds from 2.0 to 3.1. Thereâs also a DisplayPort and HDMI port outside of whatâs on the GPU, jacks for line-in and line-out, and a microphone and a gigabit Ethernet jack.\nAt 40 pounds, the Supremeâs weight is equivalent to a healthy 4-year-old.\nWhether itâs weight or graphics power, this CyberPowerPC is far from a lightweight. The Supreme is a potent pugilist equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU with 16GB of GDDR7 video memory. I finally decided to bite the bullet and finish up Black Myth Wukong. I cranked all the settings to the highest level, Cinematic for this game. At 1080p, I got a frame rate of 83 frames per second. I also wanted to see how the desktop would fare with the latest version of Nvidiaâs DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which relies on AI to boost frame rates and reduce latency. During that run of tests, the system hit 127 fps. I also ran the tests with the resolution set to 4K. I got 74 fps sans DLSS 4 which jumped to 118 fps.\nI also ran a couple of other benchmarks to see how far I could push the Supreme PC. The answer is pretty damned far. When I ran the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark, the CyberPowerPC reached 187 fps at 1080p on Ultra settings and 211 fps with DLSS enabled. Switching the resolution to 4K netted me 143 fps with DLSS and 114 fps without. And while those are impressive scores, theyâre nothing compared to the sheer might of Origin PC and its RTX 5090 GPU, which yielded scores of 244 fps with no DLSS and everything maxed out at 4K. With the technology enabled, the frame rate leaped to a face-melting 307 fps.\nFinally, I ran the Hitman 3 benchmark. Without DLSS, the desktop reached 190 fps (1080p) and 121 fps (4K), respectively. Enabling DLSS 4, the frames hit 427 fps (1080p) and 225 fps (4K).\nWhile it was incredibly tempting to spend all day gaming, thatâs not how my adult life functions nowadays. Actual work has to get done, and so I subjected the desktop to my usual workload, which is me being a tab hoarder with 55 open Google Chrome tabs. Before you judge me, the majority is a mix of G-Suite apps such as Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Then, you have a few social media and news sites and a YouTube video or two.\nTry as I might, I couldnât really trip up the Supreme and its AMD Ryzen 9800X3D processor and 32GB of RAM. In addition to my tab collection, I started editing a couple of videos and a cache of photos, but the Supreme was still purring like a kitten. And speaking of noises, the CyberPowerPCâs trio of fans didnât get louder than a gentle whirring. Even when I was fighting through Black Myth Wukong, unleashing a torrent of expletives that would make the saltiest sailor blush, the desktop kept things barely above a whisper.\nBut back to the actual performance. I ran a few benchmarks, starting with PCMark, where the desktop delivered a strong 9,981. The Supreme continued to show out on the other performance tests, including Cinebench 2024 and Geekbench 6. For its part, the Supremeâs 2TB SSD could be a tad bit faster. It took 3 minutes and 7 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p.\nIâve thoroughly enjoyed my time with the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme desktop. The design is simultaneously flashy and understated, with clean cable management. As a mid-tower, the desktop is just compact enough to fit in some of the smaller spaces in your battle station. And even at its loudest, the Supreme isnât so noisy that itâs distracting. My only design quibble lies with the ports, as I could definitely use a couple more USB-C ports.\nNow, let’s talk about the specs and performance. The Supreme is a damned-good desktop whether youâre gaming, editing video, or creating a head-turning slideshow presentation. The AMD Ryzen 7 processor and Nvidia RTX 5080 are a match made in heaven, crushing all workloads and benchmarks thrown their way. Could the SSD be a touch faster? Sure, but itâs a small complaint at the end of the day.\nGamers looking for an out-of-the-box, ass-kicking machine should consider the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme desktop.\n\nCyberPowerPC Gamer SupremedesktopGaming \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          Modders FTW!\n        \n\n          The Falcon Northwest Tiki crams all the power of a mighty gaming PC into a frame the width of a couple of hardcover books.\n        \n\n          The RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet brings smooth, powerful performance with a vivid display, great audio and solid battery life.\n        \n\n          The Origin PC Neuron 3500X looks like the kind of PC gamers would drool over, but just don't stick your books on top of it.\n        \n\n          Delight your friends and family with some awesome gadgets this holiday season.\n        \n\n          Itch.io says an AI-powered \"brand protection software\" sent phishing reports notices to its domain registrar and hosting providers, causing its domain to be disabled.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Listen. The Mac Mini can do a lot of things and do them well. But there are just certain jobs that youâll need more power than even the top-of-the-line model can handle. In those cases, itâs time to whip out the big guns, namely the Mac Studio. From its chunky size (compared to the Mac Mini) to its M4 Max or M3 Ultra chipset, the Mac Studio falls solidly in the realm of creative professionals and the AI coder wunderkinder. Plus, Apple Intelligence is baked in, so some editing tasks can be completed even faster.\nThe Studio is made for work, and youâll be hard-pressed to tax it to the point where youâll elicit anything but a soft whir from its fans. And the performance is just that damn good; the price is a horse of a different color. The base model prices are prohibitive for the average customer, and it only gets more painful as you look to expand the memory and storage.\nBut if your wallet can stomach it, the Apple Mac Studio is the new king of desktops for creative professionals and those with heavy-duty workloads.\nThe Apple Mac Studio brings incredible performance in a sleek, sliver box that can cost and arm and a leg\nThere are two configurations of the Mac Studio to consider, and neither is inexpensive. The M4 Max base model costs $1,999 and has a 14-core M4 Max chip with 36GB of unified memory, a 512GB SSD, and a 32-core M4 Max GPU. A tricked-out M4 Max Mac Studio will set you back $5,800. That eye-watering price gets you a 16-core M4 Max CPU with 128GB of unified memory, an 8TB SSD, and a 40-core GPU. My review unit falls in between with $3,699 and has the 16-core M4 Max CPU,128GB of unified RAM, and 40-core GPU with only 1TB of RAM.\nBut if you need even more power, the M3 Ultra configuration starts at $3,999. The base model uses a 28-core M3 Ultra CPU with 96GB of unified RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 60-core M3 Ultra GPU. The highest configuration of the M3 Ultra Mac features a 32-core CPU with a ridiculous 512GB of unified RAM, a 16TB SSD, and an 80-core GPU. Iâm not sure what type of work youâll be doing with that much power, but itâll cost you $14,099 for the privilege. Wowzers!!\nThe Mac Mini I reviewed last year is every bit the dainty darling. When I picked up the Mac Studio, however, it immediately triggered some 80s baby nostalgia.\nâHEFTY, HEFTY, HEFTY!â\nThe Studio is indeed hefty, weighing a solid 6.1 pounds, which jumps to an even eight pounds for the M3 Ultra model. It makes the 1.5-pound Mac Mini feel like a paperweight. And measuring 3.7 x 7.7 x 7.7 inches against the Mini’s 2 x 5 x 5 inches, the Studio easily dwarfs its little brother.\nHowever, that doesnât mean that the Studio is any less pretty. Seriously, when was the last time you saw a truly ugly product design from Apple? Iâll wait. While you ponder that question, Iâll give you a tour of the design. As expected, the exterior is made from silver anodized aluminum with gently rounded edges. The iconic half-eaten apple logo is stamped in the middle of the top of the device.\nTwo Thunderbolt 5 ports and an SDXC card reader are on the Studioâs front. And just like a mullet, the partyâs definitely in the back as there are four Thunderbolt 5 ports in the back, a pair of USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet jack, a headset jack, and AC power input. All this sits below a large rear exhaust grille meant to distribute air into the system to keep things nice and cool. Unlike its smaller counterpart, the power button is located on the back of the device instead of the undercarriage, which was my one major qualm with the Mini.\nIf you flip the Studio over, youâll see a protruding foot covered with holes. Those holes are part of Appleâs new cooling system, which moves cool air over the power supply and components. Mac Studio is pressed into the very bottom of the foot.\nNowadays, increasing numbers of gadgets are jumping on the artificial intelligence train, and a lot of major companies are developing their own version of the technology. Appleâs no different. Apple Intelligence is baked into the Studio. In fact, my review unit has a 16-core Neural Engine to handle any AI-powered tasks such as photo or video editing, utilizing generative AI or even using one of those snazzy AI video conferencing backgrounds.\nBut Apple Intelligence has a few more tricks designed to make your work go just a little smoother. The Writing Tools feature can help work through a writerâs block with its summarizing, proofreading, and rewriting capabilities. Best of all, the feature can be utilized beyond Apple apps.\nYouâll also get a helping hand from Apple Intelligence in your Mail and Messages app and Notifications. It will parse the information to the most important parts, making it easy to skim and go. This particularly comes in handy when you have a long email thread. And when itâs time to reply to an email correspondence, the Smart Reply feature can crank out a tone-appropriate response.\nI touched on the photo-editing capabilities at the top of the section. Like Googleâs Magic Eraser, Appleâs Clean Up feature can remove objects and people from photos taken with an iPhone and DSLR images. And instead of scrolling through a ton of old photos and videos looking for that specific shot, the search has been streamlined with support for natural language queries. You can also look for specific spots in videos.\nSiri is also getting an Apple Intelligence power-up. The digital assistant is a much chattier and more conversational version of Siri that can pick up on context cues. That means you can refer back to something you or Siri said in a recent request, and the digital assistant will respond in kind. My favorite part about the new, improved Siri is that it doesnât get tripped up when you stutter or have a case of brain freeze. And for questions that youâd rather not ask out loud, you can type in your query.\nThe Mac Studio runs on the latest version of macOS Sequoia. The operating system looks to be a jack-of-all-trades as it aims to optimize productivity, video conferencing, security, and, in certain cases, some gaming. As a tab hoarder, the updated window tiling is my new favorite thing. It gives me easy access to multiple tabs to quickly move between Google Docs, Adobe Photoshop, social media, and Google Chrome.\nAnd even though itâs not my default app, Safari, Appleâs web browser, is making a strong case for a promotion with the Highlights feature. It can suss out quick summaries, directions to a location, information about a song, TV show, movie, and other helpful information. And for those moments where I want to jump down a YouTube hole, Distraction Control restricts access for more focused web browsing.\nAs a journalist, I conduct a fair amount of interviews. Going back and transcribing the audio is a tedious experience that I wouldnât wish on my worst enemy. The Notes app eliminates boredom as it now supports audio transcription. And when I need to take benchmarking averages, Notes can become a makeshift calculator.\niPhone Mirroring lets iPhone owners interact with the smartphone via the desktop. It took a little less than five minutes before I scrolled through Instagram reels and every app on my iPhone. Being able to check my phoneâs notifications without having to grab my phone is a definite time saver.\nAs scammers become more sophisticated with AI scamming tools, having a different password for every login is vital. But letâs be real: Many of us donât follow that sage advice, leaving ourselves open to a serious security breach. The Passwords feature eliminates all that hassle, storing your passwords in one place, protected by end-to-end encryption.\nFor gamers, Appleâs new Game Porting Toolkit 2 gives developers handy new tools to bring games to all Macs and iOS devices. One such title is Cyberpunk 2077, a notoriously graphically-taxing title that can make lesser devices produce stuttering, unplayable messes. Assassinâs Creed Shadows will also make an appearance on Macs. This is a big step for Apple, as Macs have been written off as gaming machines due to the lack of support for console and PC games over the years.\nThereâs work, and thereâs work. You know, the kind that could potentially put a colony on Mars, edit some of the worldâs most breathtaking photography, or code the next technological boom. Thatâs what Apple has in mind with its M3 Ultra and M4 Max chipsets. The company has dubbed the latter âthe worldâs fastest CPU core,â while the former has decided to deliver âextreme performanceâ on both the CPU and GPU fronts. Both 3-nanometer chips are designed to deliver optimal performance without sacrificing efficiency, thanks to increased cores and unified memory. These chips mark the first time the big three of graphics performance come to the Studio: Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated mesh, and ray tracing.\nWhile I would have loved to get my hands on both iterations of the Studio, I have to say that the M4 Max will suffice for a lot of creative professionals. According to Apple, the CPU with its 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores offers multithreaded CPU performance thatâs twice as fast as the M1 Max and over 3x faster than the fastest 27-inch Intel-based iMac (Whew, remember when Intel in Macs was a thing?) On the graphics side, Apple claims â3.5x faster graphics performance than M1 Max, and up to 6.1x faster than the fastest Intel-based iMac.â\nAnd if that wasnât enough, here are a few other figures to mull over\nAll thatâs a fancy way of saying that I threw everything I had at the littlest tank, and it just laughed at my effort. My 80 RAM-eating tabs in Google Chrome with its mix of G-Suite apps, videos, news, entertainment, and shopping sites? Nope. Resizing a cache of 300 RAW photos to 1080p in Photoshop? Done in 1 minute and 12 seconds. Rendering five 10-minute 4K videos on DaVinci Resolve? Completed in an average of 2 minutes and 53 seconds. Itâs annoyingly good, and I vow to find something to trip this thing up. Maybe a flight simulator or some RAW video files? But for now, the Mac Studio considers my regular workflow a joke. And btw, I barely heard the fans outside of a soothing whir at times.\nThe Studio also had a big laugh at the expense of the synthetic benchmarks. For instance, it notched 3,926 on the single-core version of the Geekbench 6 test with a corresponding 25,885. The same test on theÂ CyberPowerPC Gamer SupremeÂ desktop, which has an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and theÂ Falcon Northwest Tiki (Intel Core Ultra 9 285 CPU) yielded scores of 3,142 and 3,045, respectively. The Studio also kept its pace on the multi-core section, scoring 25,885. The Tiki took second place with 21,753, and the Gamer Supreme took third with 17,148.\nI saw similar results on Cinebench 2024, where the Studio hit 2,071 and 186 on the multi- and single-thread tests, sweeping the two PCs out the door. On the Handbrake benchmark, it took the Studio 1 minute and 58 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p, speeding past the Tikiâs 2:31 and the Gamer Supremeâs time of 3:07.\nThe Mac Studio is in a class of its own. Designed for the AI coders and Disney Imagineers of the world, this little box has enough power to tackle any work task, no matter how big. The M4 Max is an absolute beast of a chip that, with the right amount of unified memory (I suggest at least 48GB), is a nigh-unstoppable force to the average consumer. Hell, I think its target audience will have problems slowing this thing down, and thatâs a great thing.\nWhile massive compared to the Mac Mini, the Studio gets the job done and stays pretty quiet. It has a host of speedy Thunderbolt 5 ports, which will come in handy for a multi-display setup or whatever dock you want to plug into this thing. Is it a bit of a chunky customer? Sure, but like most desktops, itâs not meant to travel with you over the river and through the woods. The biggest obstacle for most consumers is the price, which, if youâre trying to get the most powerful system possible, will set you back almost $15K. Thatâs a wild proposition in any economy. However, the Apple Mac Studio is best in class for the world’s heavy-duty coders and creative professionals.\n\nAppleApple Mac StudioDesktopsMacMac Studio \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          Apple could be out $20 billion because of a court's decision.\n        \n\n          What will Apple tell us about Apple Intelligence now that it's been under fire for botching it so badly?\n        \n\n          The hardware giant is dealing with all this drama because it didn't prioritize Siri long ago.\n        \n\n          Say goodbye to the 'metaverse' as even a cheap Meta Quest hasn't turned things around.

            "full_content": "Zoom sur le salaire officiel de Donald Trump et sur son patrimoine.\nEn tant que 47e prÃ©sident des Ãtats-Unis, Donald Trump dispose de pouvoirs considÃ©rables. Mais quel est son salaire officiel et quels sont les avantages dont il dispose grÃ¢ce Ã  ce poste. Câest ce que nous allons voir dans cet article.\nDans le dÃ©tail, le prÃ©sident amÃ©ricain en exercice touche un salaire de 400 000 dollars bruts par an depuis un vote du CongrÃ¨s en 2001. Au terme de son mandat de 4 ans, le chef de lâÃtat dispose Ã©galement dâune pension de 200 000 dollars par an.\nOutre cette rÃ©munÃ©ration, il bÃ©nÃ©ficie de plusieurs allocations annuelles pour ses besoins, dont une enveloppe de dÃ©placement de 100 000 dollars, une allocation personnelle non imposable de 50 000 dollars et un budget divertissement de 19 000 dollars.\nComme le dÃ©taille 20 Minutes, le prÃ©sident amÃ©ricain dispose de moyens de transport dÃ©diÃ©s :\nSâil gagne plus que le prÃ©sident franÃ§ais, le chef de lâÃtat amÃ©ricain est en revanche moins bien rÃ©munÃ©rÃ© que son homologue de la RÃ©publique de Singapour (1 600 000 dollars par an).\nOutre son salaire officiel de prÃ©sident, Donald Trump dispose Ã©galement d’un patrimoine trÃ¨s consÃ©quent. Lors de sa candidature Ã  la Maison-Blanche, il a dÃ» dÃ©clarer son patrimoine Ã  l’US Office of Government Ethics, ce qui a permis de rÃ©vÃ©ler ses placements financiers. Un document de 265 pages montre que Trump dispose dâavoirs de 2,7 milliards de dollars dans Trump Media & Technology Group (selon sa valorisation de septembre dernier), la sociÃ©tÃ© mÃ¨re de Truth Social.\nLe milliardaire est Ã©galement Ã  la tÃªte de CIC Digital LLC, qui commercialise des NFT Ã  son effigie, lui rapportant 7,2 millions de dollars. Il possÃ¨de un portefeuille de cryptomonnaies, incluant au moins un million de dollars en Ethereum. Il a Ã©galement lancÃ© sa propre monnaie numÃ©rique, ce qui lui a permis dâempocher une coquette somme.\nEn outre, le prÃ©sident a investi dans environ 850 actions amÃ©ricaines, dont Tesla, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Nvidia, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney et McDonald’s, bien que ces investissements soient souvent modestes.

            "full_content": "今年初中國新創公司深度求索（DeepSeek）推出的 AI 模型震撼了矽谷，隨後卻也因爲其中國背景引起資安疑慮。包括台灣在內，其他國家如日本、法國、德國、義大利等一票國都對其謹慎應對，台灣數發部則特別示警公務機關與關鍵基礎設施應限制使用 DeepSeek AI 產品，以避免使用者相關數據被有資安疑慮的產品傳送。\n不過，市場上其實有更多的 AI 產品，無論是軟體服務、硬體產品，雖然號稱是「來自美國的新創」或「總部位於日本東京」，但其實它們都是讓中國國內非常驕傲的「出海企業」代表，這些企業可能在美國註冊或將總部設立於日本，但研發或者招聘，卻是大量發生於中國境內，在台灣社群上引發消費者討論。\n其中，最先引起我們關注的，是日前在台灣舉辦記者會的 PLAUD.AI，該公司於今年 2 月宣布在台灣推出全球最小的穿戴式 AI 智慧錄音膠囊「PLAUD NotePin」，並聲稱擁有「雲端無限儲存設計」，在那場記者會中，PLAUD.AI 稱這些資料將被存放於亞馬遜（Amazon）的 AWS 上，並透過 PLAUD App 或 Web 平台進行即時轉寫和摘要總結等，並稱其「採用了加密技術，在每個環節都將隱私保護列為首要考量。」\nPLAUD.AI 的相關產品，目前正在台灣募資平台嘖嘖進行募資，並且也能時常在 Instagram、X 等社群平台看到有不少網紅或知識型 KOL 拍攝短影音推薦其產品，但在這些影片留言底下，都能看到不少消費者詢問此產品的產地以及團隊是否來自中國等質問。\n經過調查，我們發現 PLAUD.AI 雖稱自己是來自美國新創的 AI 企業，但開發出這些產品背後的公司其實是一家名為「深圳機智連接科技有限公司」的中國企業，創立於 2021 年，於 2023 年推出 PLAUD.AI 品牌及產品「智慧錄音卡 PLAUD NOTE」，法定負責人為許高，公司地址位於深圳。\n此外，在編輯於 3 月 6 日查看其招聘頁面時，可以發現招聘職位達到 73 個（順帶一提，當我們在 2/20 進行首次調查時招聘數量為 59 個），且這些職缺全位於深圳以及北京，其中 2 個職位分別負責日本以及北美市場的亞馬遜等電商平台的營運，但一樣在中國境內工作。\n不過，PLAUD.AI 的確有在美國進行「註冊」，經查，有兩個註冊於美國達拉瓦州（位於美國東岸）的紀錄，分別是註冊於 2024 年 5 月的 PLAUD INC.，以及註冊於 2025 年 1 月的 PLAUD LLC，註冊地址以及電話都是一樣的。\n而在今年的 CES 大會上，PLAUD.AI 的頁面介紹，則自稱來自另一家公司： Nicebuild LLC 。\n經查，在美國懷俄明州（位於美國西部）的公司登記網站，確實有 Nicebuild LLC 這家公司，於 2021 年註冊。\n因此總結下來，前面查到的 PLAUD INC. 以及 PLAUD LLC 位於美國東岸，Nicebuild LLC 則位於美國西部。\n而其實早在 2024 年 1 月，Reddit 上就有不少美國網友提出對 PLAUD 的隱私問題，該網友認為其隱私政策不可信，並向美國消費者提出警告。\n其中一位網友指出，Nicebuild LLC 是從一家名為 iZyrec 分拆出來的公司，後者是一家製造便宜錄音設備並在亞馬遜銷售的中國公司，地址同樣位於深圳。\n而在 iZYREC 的官網上，則表示自己是 Nicebuild LLC 旗下的品牌。\n可以確定的是，Nicebuild LLC 跟 iZYREC 有相當緊密的關係，而台灣募資平台 flyingV 上也有 iZYREC 隱形錄音卡的募資紀錄，頁面最底下確實有寫產品製造商為 「Nicebuild LLC」。\n因此，綜上所說，PLAUD.AI 確實在美國留有公司註冊紀錄，然而實際上其營運、招聘工作目前顯然大量在中國。\n至於該公司在 LinkdeIn 上的招聘職位，則是在台灣記者會約一週前發布的。目前（3 月 6 號）頁面上僅有 6 個在美國的職缺，3 個位於舊金山、3 個位於西雅圖，職缺描述上都寫著：「我們新成立的舊金山總部將與我們在深圳、北京和東京的團隊合作」。\n總結來說，這家在台灣記者會上稱自己是「美國新創」的公司，目前有 73 個職位位於中國深圳，6 個職位位於美國，而這 6 個職位是在記者會開始不久之前才開始招聘的。\n在我們調查期間，可以在諸多中國科技新聞網站上，看見不少文章讚譽這家成功的 AI 企業「深圳出品」，並被譽為「出海成功代表」。\n例如擁有 350 萬訂閱讀者、中國相當具有代表性的科技媒體「量子位」，在去年 7 月就刊出了文章，內文標題：「深圳 70 人创业团队出品」。\n另外，SocialBook 全球红人营销 這個平台，則專門撰寫了一篇文章，探討這家來自深圳的新銳廠商如何利用網紅在全球行銷。\n另一家極具代表性的中國科技網站「雷科技」，則沒有大力吹捧該產品來自中國，而是談到了 NotePin 的數據隱私問題，其中有幾句話值得我們注意：\n繁體轉換一下：「在 Plaud 的新聞稿中，該公司描述 NotePin 可以『主動激活』（主動開啟之意）， 隨著時間的推移，學習和理解其用戶，以便在重要會議或事件前後『自動激活』。」\n再繁體轉換一下：「為了打消用戶疑慮，Plaud 承諾提供『業界領先的加密』，利用自有 PLAUD Privacy Cloud（PPC）來確保資料得到安全處理，以確保用戶隱私安全。當然這只是官方的說法，用戶隱私究竟能不能得到妥善的處置還要看後續發展。」\n我們再回過頭來，看看 PLAUD 的網站（國際版）是怎麼描述他們的隱私政策的：\n原則上，我們的產品透過 Google Cloud 服務收集和產生的個人資訊將儲存在美國。\n由於我們透過位於世界各地的資源和伺服器提供我們的產品或服務，這意味著您的個人資訊可能會轉移到您使用產品或服務所在國家/地區以外的司法管轄區，或從這些司法管轄區存取。\n可以發現，在國際版網站並沒有提到 AWS。\n選擇台灣網站之後，隱私權政策頁面則是寫著：「PLAUD 使用 Google Cloud 提供安全的基礎設施支持，以確保數據的完整性和可用性，並對第三方供應商進行定期風險評估。」\n也就是說，官方網站上，並沒有明確寫出使用者的資料儲存在哪個平台、哪個國家，僅在記者會時與參與會議的記者提到資料儲存於 AWS 上。\n該公司另一款產品 PLAUD Note 錄音卡的網頁上則是三大雲端商的 logo 皆有，並寫著：「由全球領先的雲端服務提供商保障」，但沒有像美國的頁面那樣，明確寫出使用者的資料儲存在哪個平台、哪個國家。\n在中國的 AWS 頁面上，可以看到專門介紹 PLAUD.AI 的介紹故事，頁面當中寫道：\n「亚马逊云科技 Pro-serve 团队还携手律所等合作伙伴为 PLAUD.AI 提供了一体化的安全合规解决方案，助其解决整个系统架构中数据存储、数据处理、权限管理各个环节数据安全问题，更好地实现海外业务拓展。」\n其中提到的 Pro-serve 團隊，實際上就是在中國提供的 AWS China 專業服務。\n「AWS 在中國」的頁面則有寫道，其為「針對中國需求打造的基礎架構」，而 AWS 中國 (北京) 區域和 AWS 中國 (寧夏) 區域則是由 AWS 和兩家「中國本地營運合作夥伴」 – 光环新网、西云数据合作，並遵守中國的法律和監管要求。\n那麼問題來了，台灣消費者的數據會被儲存在哪裡呢？\n根據 PLAUDE Taiwan 粉絲頁上的官方回應，是這麼寫的：PLAUD.AI 是美國團隊，NotePin 這款產品是使用 AWS、Azure 以及 Google Cloud。\n由於這款產品的隱私問題，已在台灣社群網站上被對這款產品有興趣的消費者熱烈討論，經《INSIDE》編輯詢問，PLAUD.AI 回應如下：\n隨著生成式 AI 各類服務的迅速發展，市場上具有競爭力的產品更容易引起消費者的注意，更不要說 PLAUD.AI 的產品是以錄音、轉錄為主要服務並且主打「專業人士」的好用工具，原本就會受到消費者高度檢視，更應該盡快統一對消費者以及對媒體的說法。\n尤其是有關隱私權的頁面。事實上就在截稿之前，連美國的頁面也仍是描述為「使用 Google Cloud」而非美國的 AWS，至於台灣消費者要如何判斷該公司究竟是美商還是中國企業，就看消費者各自的判斷了。\n加入 INSIDE 會員，獨享 INSIDE 科技趨勢電子報，點擊立刻成為會員！"

Expect to receive your first email very soon!\nGrieving widow Jennifer Jacoby is suing the owners of the Venetian and Palazzo hotels in Las Vegas following the passing of her husband, Jeffrey Jacoby, during a work trip in March 2023.\nThe lawsuit, filed for wrongful death, alleges that the 55-year-old Colorado resident lost his life from a fentanyl ov**dose after being dru**ed and subsequently robbed by a s*x worker and her procurer, Kashon Glass.\nThe paper details how Jeff met the call girl, Cheylee Kessee, at the establishment’s bar at around 1 am. The pair then walked for nearly forty minutes before heading to a cashier, where Jeff withdrew $1,000. \nJeff and Kessee then made their way to his hotel room, with Glass following them from a distance and keeping in contact with the s*x worker via text messages. Just eight minutes later, the woman left the room, leaving the husband “slumped on the bathroom floor.”\nImage credits: Jenny Pillsbury Jacoby\nJennifer, who described her late husband as her “soulmate” and “twin flame” in his obituary, is now seeking justice through a lawsuit against the Palazzo’s owners, Venetian Casino Resort LLC.\nThe lawsuit claims that the hotel’s security staff should have alerted Jeff to the fact that he was being followed by Glass, as both Kessee and Glass had a history of “targeting hotel guests to rob and victimize them.” \nThe suit alleges that casino operators were aware of their activities but failed to take proper action to protect guests like Jeff.\nImage credits: Horan & McConaty Funeral Service and Cremation\nBen Edwards, a Law professor at the University of Nevada, commented on the case, believing it to have some merit on the grounds of the casino’s potential negligence.\nImage credits: Wikimedia\n“Anytime you invite somebody onto your property, you have an obligation to make sure the place is safe,” he stated, explaining that the lawsuit ultimately hinges on whether the hotel failed to prevent known dangers.\n“The kinds of dangers you have to protect against are real dangers you know about. You have to try to prevent known dangers. The question the court will figure out is whether it was unreasonable for the casino to not monitor, or not communicate, for this sort of thing.”\nImage credits: Cheylee Kessee\nShortly after Jeff’s body was discovered, Kessee and Glass were apprehended and charged with m*rder.\nThe pair was accused of supplying a lethal dose of fenta*yl, a potent synthetic opioid dr*g that is stated by experts to be “100 times” stronger than m*rphine and “50 times” more intense than her*in.\nImage credits: Cheylee Kessee\nThe culprits then struck a plea deal by admitting to voluntary manslaughter and robbery.\nGlass was sentenced to 50 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after 20 years, while Kessee received a shorter, 20-year sentence with the possibility of parole after serving 8 years.\nImage credits: Cheylee Kessee\nA ceremony was held in honor of Jeff Jacoby’s life at the Mission Hills Church in Colorado on March 13, 2023.\nHis obituary described him as a caring father whose great joy in life was raising his three daughters. “He was there for every moment and milestone, cheering his girls on daily.”\nImage credits: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\n“His wife, Jenny, was the greatest love of his life aside from the Lord. They loved to spend time drinking coffee and sitting out on the back porch in the morning sun together, going to church on Sunday mornings.”\nThe lawsuit does not specify the amount Jennifer is seeking in damages from the Palazzo’s owners, but her family hopes to hold the hotel accountable for the circumstances that led to Jeff’s death.\nImage credits: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\n“In Nevada, all types of property owners are legally obligated to keep their premises reasonably safe,” wrote Robert W. Cottle, former Trial Lawyer of Nevada, on his website. \n“For hotels, casinos, and other types of commercial properties, this legal obligation includes strong security measures.” \nImage credits: Jenny Pillsbury Jacoby\nCottle explained that injuries happening as a result of a failure to meet these standards fall under a concept known as “premises liability.”\nTo establish a successful liability claim, it’s crucial to prove that the defendant “either caused, was aware of, or should have been aware of the dangerous condition.”\nImage credits: Jenny Pillsbury Jacoby\nAnother important concept is “foreseeability,” which comes into play when a property has a history of guests being victimized by violent crime.\n“Ownership has a legal duty to put security measures in place to reduce the risk of further violent crimes,” Cottle added.\nAnyone can write on Bored Panda.

            "full_content": "Last week the Department of Justice and some state attorneys general filed revised proposed remedies in the U.S. v. Google LLC search case. If the proposed remedies barring all search payments to browser developers are adopted by the court, these misguided plans would be a direct hit to small and independent browsers—the very forces that keep the web open, innovative and free. This case was meant to promote search competition, yet somehow the outcome threatens to crush browser competition, making it even harder for challengers to stand up to dominant players like Google, Apple and Microsoft.\n“These proposed remedies prohibiting search payments to small and independent browsers miss the bigger picture—and the people who will suffer most are everyday internet users,” said Mark Surman, President of Mozilla. “Independent browsers like Firefox are on the frontlines of protecting consumer privacy, driving browser innovation, and giving people real choice on how they experience the web. But instead of promoting a fair fight, the DOJ’s remedies would tilt the playing field further into the hands of a few dominant players, diminishing consumer choice and weakening the broader internet ecosystem.”\nMozilla agrees that we need to improve search competition, but the DOJ’s proposed remedies unnecessarily risk harming browser competition instead.\n“The big unintended consequence here is the handing of power from one dominant player to another. So, from Google Search to Microsoft, or Bing for example—while shutting out the smaller, independent challengers that actually drive browser innovation and offer web users privacy and choice,” Surman added.\nThe last unicorn–the web can’t afford to lose Mozilla’s browser engine\nAnother thing missing from this conversation is something pretty important—browser engine competition.\nYou see, browser engines power the web. They are central to a browser’s speed, privacy and security functionality, and the browser’s ability to innovate and do things differently. But they’re very complex and require massive resources and a deep technical expertise to maintain—so much so, that right now only three major browser engines remain: Google’s Chromium, Apple’s Webkit (this engine is really only supported on Apple devices, and isn’t considered “cross-platfrom”), and then there’s Mozilla’s Gecko (which happens to be the only true cross-platform alternative to Chromium).\nThe DOJ’s proposal to bar search payments to independent browser developers would put Mozilla’s ability to develop and maintain Gecko at risk. If Mozilla is unable to sustain our browser engine, it would severely impact browser engine competition and mean the death of the open web as we know it—essentially, creating a web where dominant players like Google and Apple, have even more control, not less.\n“This isn’t just about Firefox,” Surman explained. “If we lose our ability to maintain Gecko, it’s game over for an open, independent web. Look, Microsoft—a $3 trillion company—already gave up its browser engine in 2019 and Opera gave up theirs in 2013. If Mozilla is forced out, Google’s Chromium becomes the only cross-platform browser engine left.”\nNevermind our market share, Mozilla has played an outsized role in keeping the web open, private and advocating for choice. Firefox still serves 27 million monthly active users (MAU) in the U.S. and nearly 205 million MAU globally, but our real impact comes from making the internet better by:\n“This isn’t something we do because it’s profitable or easy,” said Surman. “We do it because it matters. The DOJ’s proposal doesn’t just miss the mark, it risks handing even more power to dominant industry players like Google or Apple, not less.”\nMozilla calls on regulators and policymakers to recognize the vital role of independent browsers and take action to nurture competition, innovation, and protect the public interest in the evolving digital landscape.\nMozilla is committed to ensuring a fair and competitive internet ecosystem, one where independent browsers can compete on a level playing field and consumers have real choice. The future of competition, innovation and the open internet depends on us.\n\n          Browser choice?

            "full_content": "When people hear the words desktop computer, many think of a massive behemoth. The visual gets a heaping helping of RGB when you throw the word âgamingâ into the mix. But not all gaming desktops have to be massive. Want proof? Take a look at the Falcon Northwest Tiki, a compact powerhouse that can hold its own with the big boys. In the slim confines of the Tiki awaits an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor and a Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU waiting to unleash hell upon your enemies, be they computer generated or flesh and bone. Itâs the perfect solution for those who want maximum gaming power but are short on space. The only problem? The price.\nFalcon Northwest Tiki\nThe Falcon Northwest Tiki crams a load of powerful components into a seriously svelte chassis\nDespite its small frame, Falcon makes sure youâre spoiled for choice on the configurations for the Tiki. However, Falcon and every other OEM are being hit with tariffs, which means theyâre passing it on to you, dear reader. At the time of this writing, itâs a 5% price increase. Which doesnât seem like much. But if youâve ever built your own PC, you know that sourcing components can quickly become a pricey affair.\nSo that means the Tiki base model outfitted with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265 processor costs $5,407. It also has an Intel Laminar RH1 Cooler, a pair of 16GB Kingston Fury Beast RGB DDR4 6,000MHz RAM, a Asus ROG Strix Z890-E Gaming WiFi Motherboard, a Kingston Fury Renegade 2TB PCIe M.2 SSD, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU with 16GB of VRAM, and a SilverStone SX SFX-L Platinum 1,000W PSU.\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 9600X CPU base model is a little cheaper at $5,354. Outside of the processor swap, you also get the Noctua NH-L9a-AM5 Chromax Black Air Cooler. And thereâs my actual review build, which costs $5,740, has a 2.5-GHz Intel Core Ultra 9 285 CPU, a pair of 32GB Kingston Fury Beast RGB DDR4 6,000MHz RAM, and a Crucial T705a 2TB PCIe M.2 Gen 5.0 SSD. My configuration also has an RGB-backlit Falcon emblem along with a three-sided custom UV print. Each build uses Microsoft Windows 11 Pro as an operating system and has a 3-year parts & labor warranty.\nI love a good SFF (Small Form Factor) system, and Falcon Northwest makes some of the best. The compact chassis is made from black anodized aluminum, with a thick base that ensures the system isnât tipping over or sliding away easily. As the pictures show, I donât have a regular-schmegular design. Falcon hooked me up with one of its custom UV prints, which are available for $149 for the front or a single side panel or $399 for all three sides. The company prides itself on having the âhighest resolution UV printer in the industryâ at 600 dpi. Just send over your image idea and the company can print on your systemâjust make sure itâs a high-resolution image for the best result.\nMy Tiki has one of the companyâs pre-made prints. Available in several colors, the print mimics a massive circuit board. The green paint that makes up the circuits is semi-glossy, giving a cool embossed look. And of course, thereâs the companyâs titular Falcon mascot on both sides looking menacing and badass. And like I mentioned in the configurations section, the cut-out emblem of the mascot on the PCâs front panel is RGB backlit.\nThe top panel is almost all geometric vent cutouts. But there’s also a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port and two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports. You also have the power and fan buttons. Take a gander around the back of the Micro-Tower, and you have the usual gathering, such as a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-C 3.2 port, two USB-A 2.0 ports, two USB-A 3.0 ports, and a pair of USB-A 3.2 ports. Thereâs also an HDMI 2.1 port, an Ethernet jack, a pair of connectors for a Wi-Fi antenna, and the AC input jack for the thick power cord.\nOpening the case is a breeze. You simply unscrew the two large screws holding the right-side panel in place and slide it off to reveal the heavily feng shui-ed components. The GPU takes up the top quarter of the space leaving the rest to the CPU, motherboard, and glowing RGB RAM. Not an inch of space is wasted, and surprisingly youâve got enough slots to increase the RAM to 96GB if you so desire.\nMeasuring 4 x 13.6 x 13 inches, the Tikiâs slim frame is the answer to many apartment dwellers’ prayers, or anyone who doesnât have a lot of space to spare. It can easily slide into a tight spot and still be the epicenter of your gaming experience. Just be sure to lift with your knees, as the case starts at 18 pounds with the base. The weight can change drastically depending on what components are included in the build.\nIn many ways, the Tiki has a lot in common with boxing legend Tommy âThe Hit Manâ Hearns. They both have smaller frames but pack a hell of a punch. Armed with a Nvidia RTX 5080 Founders Edition GPU, there isnât much that the Tiki canât do. Despite that slim frame, itâs not to be trifled with. And while I was really tempted to spend inordinate hours playing through the new Hades 2 update, I was an adult and played some more taxing fare. Then I went and played inordinate hours of Hades 2.\nI started things off with another game that Iâve died in time and time again: Black Myth Wukong. For these benchmarks, I kept the game running at its highest setting, Cinematic, and adjusted resolution and effects accordingly. So when I ran the game at 1080p, I saw an average frame rate of 76 frames per second. Turning on DLSS raised the frame rate to 116 fps, while bringing ray tracing in the mix dropped it to 89 fps. Compare that to the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme I recently reviewed which also has a RTX 5080, only its an MSI Ventus 3X OC card. On that same run of tests, I saw results of 83, 127, and 92 fps, respectively.\nThe Falcon continues having a good showing at 4K with 69 fps without DLSS, 108 fps with the feature, and 84 fps with ray tracing enabled. Those are great numbers, but not a match for the Gamer Supreme, which gave me 74 fps sans DLSS 118 with and 95 fps with ray tracing.\nNext up, I ran the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark on Ultra settings, which is notoriously taxing. But the Tiki, powerhouse that it is, handled it gracefully. For our 1080p results, I got an average 189 fps with no effects, a ridiculous 371 fps with DLSS, and 361 fps with ray tracing. This was a closer race with the Gamer Supreme, as it only reached 187 fps without effects, 211 fps with DLSS, and 202 fps with ray tracing added.\nAt 4K, the Falcon Tiki got 143 fps on the non-effects run, 270 fps with DLSS, and 267 with ray tracing on top. Meanwhile, the Gamer Supreme produced 114, 143 and 139 fps, respectively.\nAnd finally, I ran the Hitman 3 Dartmoor Benchmark on High at 1080p. Sans special sauce, the Tiki notched 122 fps, which rose to 327 fps with DLSS enabled and only gained a frame with ray tracing added to the mix. The Gamer Supreme chewed up the benchmark, starting with 190 sans effects, launching into an unheard of 427 fps with DLSS and 420 fps with ray tracing.\nCranking things up to 4K, the Tiki produced 159, 190, and 191 fps to the CyberPowerPCâs 121, 225, and 224 fps.\nThere comes a time in every gamerâs life when they have to put down the controller and use that mouse for something other than headshotting their foes. When that time comes, know that Tiki has you covered with its 2.5-GHz Intel Core Ultra 9 285 processor and its 64GB of RAM. The svelte system seemed to give a sarcastic snort as I unleashed my 70 Google Chrome tabs with an unruly mix of G-Suite apps, social media pages, news sites, and videos. It even kept its cool when I started editing loads of videos. Did the fans get a little loud? Sure, but not so much it was a distraction.\nSo letâs get into some synthetic benchmarks where the Tikiâs Intel CPU duked it out with the CyberPowerPCâs AMD Ryzen 9800X3D processor. It was a close fight on the PCMark 10 test, but the Gamer Supreme inched out a narrow victory at 9,981 to 9,819. The fight continued on the Geekbench 6 tests, with the CyberPowerPC snatching the win on the single-core round 3,142 to 3,045. However, the Tiki staged a comeback on the multi-core 21,753 to 17,148. The Tiki earned decisive wins on both aspects of the Cinebench 2024 benchmark.\nAnd when it comes to transcoding video, the Tiki is your huckleberry, taking only 2 minutes and 31 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. The Gamer Supreme took 3:07. The Falcon was also faster on both the CPU and GPU portions of the Blender tests, with times of 1:19 and 1:29 compared to its competition (1:45 and 1:42).\nThinâs been in for a while over at Falcon Northwest and with good reason. The company has consistently managed to gracefully fit some of the most powerful components into a seemingly impossible space, without sacrificing power. And while you might be tempted to shuffle the SFF PC off into a tight space never to be heard from again, I implore you to treat it better than that. I got so many comments on how good it looked from the Gizmodo staff, youâd be doing yourself and the Micro-Tower a disservice.\nMy configuration performed above and beyond expectations and reminded me that everything doesnât have to be massive to be good. I just wish the pricing were as slim as the Tikiâs dimensions. The Tiki was already expensive, but adding tariffs on top means that only the deepest pocketed gamers can enjoy this slim fataleâs allure. But if you can afford it, the svelte Falcon Northwest Tiki is an awesome pre-built system just waiting to turn heads and kick ass.\n\nDesktopsFalcon NorthwestGamingGaming Desktops \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          Modders FTW!\n        \n\n          The Apple Mac Studio comes bearing ridiculous power far beyond the needs of the average consumer with a price to match.\n        \n\n          The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme brings powerful performance in a convenient, prebuilt system for plug-and-play gaming\n        \n\n          The RedMagic Nova Gaming Tablet brings smooth, powerful performance with a vivid display, great audio and solid battery life.\n        \n\n          Delight your friends and family with some awesome gadgets this holiday season.\n        \n\n          Itch.io says an AI-powered \"brand protection software\" sent phishing reports notices to its domain registrar and hosting providers, causing its domain to be disabled.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "B&H reportedly purchased Brookfield’s 10-story 333 West 34th Street building for $150 million. The 287,000-square-foot property is just around the corner from the photo retailer’s iconic retail store at 420 Ninth Avenue. \nThis news arrives according to real estate publication The Real Deal, which reports that B&H scored a significant deal on the property. While the $150 million price tag sounds extreme, it is $105 million less than the building’s prior owner, Brookfield, spent on it in 2018. This loss reflects the changing real estate market in New York. \nWhile The Real Deal first reported the deal on Monday, the new owner didn’t become apparent until property records were released the following day.\nB&H purchased the building through an LLC signed by Zalman Gottlieb, B&H’s financial controller. It’s not clear who brokered the deal, as B&H did not respond to The Real Deal‘s request for comment. \nHowever, a spokesperson for Brookfield confirmed the sale of the 333 West 34th Street building to Commercial Observer. \n“The sale of 333 West 34th Street to a user is a win for both parties, granting this strategic buyer control over its future home and allowing Brookfield to deploy capital toward high-performing assets elsewhere,” the Brookfield spokesperson said. \nThe building has a few current tenants, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music, and Godiva. According to property database Compstak, the MTA is leasing between 100,000 and 150,000 square feet in the building through 2035, while Sam Ash Music’s 20-30,000 square-foot lease expires in 2032. Chocolate company Godiva’s lease for 40-50,000 square feet of office space expires next year. \nWhile B&H has yet to comment on the acquisition, that a Brookfield spokesperson referred to the buyer as securing its “future home” is notable. The proximity to B&H’s famed storefront, just around the corner from the new property, is also noteworthy. It would not be a complicated move from a practical or marketing standpoint. It is also worth considering that the newly purchased building is more extensive than B&H’s current space, and B&H reportedly has separate executive offices in an adjacent building. \nImage credits: Header photo licensed via Depositphotos.\nBecome a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free.\n© 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

            "full_content": "Mostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\n\nEugene Volokh\n\n|\n3.24.2025 9:23 AM\n\nFrom Watts v. KOS Media LLC, decided Tuesday by the Nevada Court of Appeals (Chief Judge Bonnie Bulla, joined by Judges Michael Gibbons and Deborah Westbrook):\nWatts sued respondent KOS Media LLC, alleging that it was liable under NRS 41.1347 (Nevada's anti-doxing statute) for posting and/or facilitating the posting of an article that allegedly contained Watts' personal identifying information on its website \"The Daily KOS.\" The post, entitled: \"Heartland Fundraising for Tony Watts' $2,000 Thermometers to Compete with Global Temp Network,\" was made by a user named \"ClimateDenierRoundup\" and contained links to the Zillow listing for Watts' Nevada residence, as well as its location on Google Maps.\nWatts alleged that, due to his status as a well-known climate pundit, the release of his address on the internet increased his risk of death or bodily injury by climate activists, allowing him to recover damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs. Watts later filed a first amended complaint, which included alternative allegations that KOS either posted the article itself through an employee, or \"aided and abetted\" a third party in creating the article and knew that it contained personal and potentially harmful information prior to posting….\nThe trial court dismissed this claim, \"under NRS 41.1347(6), which provides that '[t]his section must not be construed to impose liability on any interactive computer service for any content provided by another person,'\" but the appellate court concluded this was premature:\nWhile Watts did include allegations in his complaint that indicated KOS aided and abetted a third party in posting the article; he also included an alternative theory, namely that \"an individual associated with or employed by KOS Media LLC, and not a third party posted the content\" alongside several other references noting that KOS \"created\" or \"supplied\" the content that disseminated his personal identifying information. Further, Watts' complaint also includes allegations that the disclaimer on the KOS website {\"[t]his content is not subject to review by Daily KOS staff prior to publication\"} is incorrect, and that \"KOS staff has reviewed the subject posting prior to publication and/or after, calling the disclaimer into question.\"\nBecause this alternative theory of liability posits that KOS itself, not a third party, disseminated Watts' personal identifying information, we conclude the district court erred when it determined that KOS is entitled to statutory immunity under NRS 41.1347(6) at this stage of the process. When treating this allegation as true, KOS fails to demonstrate that the content at issue here was \"provided by another person\" as required for immunity under the statute.\nThe court therefore allowed the case to go forward (though of course ultimately KOS might well prevail, for instance if the post was indeed put up by an unrelated third party).\nThe Nevada doxing statute allows lawsuit by one person against some \"other person\" when\n(a) The other person disseminates any personal identifying information or sensitive information [defined as sexual orientation, transgender status, or HIV status] of the person without the consent of the person, knowing that the person could be identified by such information:\n(1) With the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or promote any criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death, bodily injury or stalking; or\n(2) With the intent to cause harm to the person and with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the information may cause death, bodily injury or stalking; and\n(b) The dissemination of the personal identifying information or sensitive information:\n(1) Would cause a reasonable person to fear the death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation; or\n(2) Causes the death, bodily injury or stalking of the person whose information was disseminated or a close relation of the person.\nIt also provides exceptions for dissemination:\n(a) For the purposes of reporting conduct reasonably believed to be unlawful;\n(b) Which depicts a law enforcement officer acting under the color of law or an elected officer of the State of Nevada or any of its political subdivisions acting in an official capacity;\n(c) Gathered in the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and assembly; or\n(d) Which is a good faith communication in furtherance of the right to petition or the right to free speech in direct connection with an issue of public concern[, meaning] {\nI think there are good arguments that statutes such as this are unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, but in this appeal KOS Media only raised the service provider immunity argument.\nJeffrey Dickerson represents Watts.\nStart your day with Reason.

            "full_content": "Арбитражный суд Москвы наложил арест на имущество бывшего гендиректора ООО «Гугл» Юлии Соловьевой, которое оценивается в 232,8 млн руб., а также на четыре ее автомобиля на 13,5 млн руб. Об этом говорится в определении суда, которое есть в распоряжении «Ведомостей».\nВ документе отмечено, что рассматривается заявление конкурсного управляющего ООО «Гугл» Валерия Таляровского, который попросил привлечь солидарно к субсидиарной ответственности по обязательствам должника Google International LLC, Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited, Соловьеву, бывших гендиректоров Дэвида Мунро Снэддона, Дасаро Биондо Карло Сальваторе Мариа, а также бывшего топ-менеджера Юлию Рамазанову. Таляровский также просил приостановить рассмотрение заявления в части определения размера ответственности. 25 февраля в Арбитражный суд поступило ходатайство ФНС России (в лице МИ ФНС России по крупнейшим налогоплательщикам № 7) о принятии обеспечительных мер в отношении имущества Соловьевой.\nЗаявитель указал, что обеспечительные меры поспособствуют тому, чтобы у кредиторов сохранилась возможность получения удовлетворения своих требований. Отмечается, что уже зафиксированы факты отчуждения ряда объектов имущества Соловьевой во время осуществления процедуры банкротства. Речь о земельном участке и жилом доме в подмосковной Истре, а также мотоцикле BMW.\nВ определении отмечается, что, как полагает уполномоченный орган, в этой ситуации запрет на отчуждение имущества и наложение ареста на имеющиеся денежные средства, а также на те, что поступят в будущем на расчетные счета в пределах суммы иска, не нарушают прав собственника. Обеспечительные меры в целом «направлены на сохранение существующего положения и обеспечение баланса интересов заинтересованных сторон до разрешения спора по существу».\nКак рассказал «Ведомостям» партнер адвокатского бюро «Арт де Лекс» Артур Зарубян, принятие обеспечительных мер по требованию о привлечении к субсидиарной ответственности в виде ареста активов привлекаемых к ответственности топ-менеджеров должника – довольно стандартная практика для процедур банкротства, особенно если речь идет о заявлении государственных (квазигосударственных) структур типа налоговых органов или ГК АСВ, и дело о банкротстве ООО «Гугл» – не исключение. По его словам, налоговый орган является основным реестровым кредитором, контролирующим более 95% требований, включенных в реестр требований кредиторов ООО «Гугл». Требования налогового органа основаны на штрафах и подтверждены вступившими в законную силу судебными актами, отметил он.\nЗарубян добавил, что до лета 2016 г. Соловьева была гендиректором ООО «Гугл», потом также занимала значимые позиции – на дату ухода Google из России в марте 2022 г. была управляющим директором.\n«Как следует из заявления о привлечении к субсидиарной ответственности, конкурсный управляющий ООО «Гугл» рассматривает госпожу Соловьеву как фактического руководителя должника. Таким образом, такое решение суда с учетом имеющейся практики является ожидаемым», – сказал Зарубян.\n19 февраля Арбитражный суд Москвы удовлетворил в приоритетном порядке требования бывших сотрудников ООО «Гугл». В октябре прошлого года Таляровский обратился суд с просьбой разрешить удовлетворить требования бывших работников организации в приоритетном порядке по отношению к требованиям текущих кредиторов (возникшим после возбуждения дела о банкротстве, в их числе находится большинство российских телеканалов).

Pour yourself a mug of Tolima Los Brasiles Peaberry coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads:\n• Zyn and the New Nicotine Gold Rush: White snus pouches were designed to help Swedish women quit cigarettes. They’ve become a staple for American dudes. (New Yorker)\n• Drones and ‘Game Film’: Inside Chick-fil-A’s Quest to Make Fast Food Faster: The booming chicken chain aims to reinvent the drive-through process; reducing bottlenecks in the ‘cockpit’ (Wall Street Journal) see also Fast-er food: A productivity surge at U.S. restaurants: From the very beginning, fast-food restaurants were designed to be the epitome of productivity. Nearly everything about them was geared toward serving customers as quickly and efficiently as possible (NPR)\n• The $32 Billion Wizards Who Picked the Best Time to Start a Company: The Worst Time: Google just made its biggest deal ever for Wiz, a cybersecurity startup founded only five years ago. It’s even unlikelier than it sounds. (Wall Street Journal)\n• Rebuffed: A Closer Look at Options-Based Strategies: The holy grail for many investors is a strategy that generates market-like returns, but with less risk. Enter options-based strategies, often labeled with words like “Buffered,” “Overlay,” and “Defined Outcome.” These strategies use options to capture the upside or downside of an asset’s returns, and managers who employ a mix of options can tailor an asset’s risk/return profile to align with an investor’s goals. (Options trading-related categories have amassed $234 billion in AUM). Investors should expect disappointment from these types of strategies — the actual results have been overwhelmingly disappointing, and economic theory says these strategies should be overwhelmingly disappointing. (AQR)\n• Oracle of the Apocalypse: Human beings are the apes that forget. While the list of today’s pressing global challenges is long – climate change, pandemics, increasing authoritarian politics, fiscal deficits, and demographic decay, to name just a few – all of them put together don’t hold a candle to the risk that the planet could stumble into the nuclear abyss. (William Bernstein)\n• The Social Turn: Psychoanalysis at an inflection point: Psychoanalysis, I’d heard, was modernizing. APsA was opening up to the broader world. There was a push to bring in new members, as well as a rising tide of psychoanalytic work that sought to make analysis more accessible to and effective for people of different stripes. I wanted to understand what these changes meant for clinicians and patients and whether they were being resisted. What would it take for psychoanalysis to change? (Harpers)\n• Ghosts among the philosophers Cambridge, home of analytic philosophy, was also a hotbed of psychical research. How did this spooky subject take root? (Aeon)\n• “Knowingness” and the Politics of Ignorance: Much ink has been spilled about “polarization.” Most of it ignores a major cause: the widespread, misplaced faith that we already know that which we do not know. (The Garden of the Forking Paths)\n• Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece. The recent discovery of an art forger’s workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out. (BBC)\n• The 2025 NCAA Men’s Tournament Bracket Breakdown: Which teams can win it all? Which can’t you trust? And what are the Cinderella candidates you should be most aware of? That and more ahead of the start of March Madness. (The Ringer)\nBe sure to check out our Masters in Business interview  this weekend with Jim O’Shaughnessy, founder and CEO of O’Shaughnessy Ventures LLC (“OSV”), an investor in and accelerator of creative endeavors, fueling the worlds of art/science/tech.

Такое решение вынесено в рамках заявления конкурсного управляющего российского подразделения Google Валерия Таляровского о привлечении к ответственности по обязательствам российского юрлица Google International LLC, Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited, бывшего гендиректора «Гугл» Дэвида Мунро Снэддона, Соловьёвой и др.\nИсточник изображения: Racool_studio / Freepik\nТаляровский сообщил, что принятие обеспечительных мер позволит сохранить возможность удовлетворения требований кредиторов. Он отметил, что уполномоченные органы в период проведения банкротства наложили арест на земельный участок, жилой дом в Подмосковье и мотоцикл BMW, принадлежащие Юлии Соловьёвой.\nНапомним, ООО «Гугл» объявило о намерении обратиться в суд с целью признания банкротства ещё в мае 2022 года. Позднее суд признал заявление компании обоснованным и ввёл наблюдение на полгода. После рассмотрения апелляции было повторно назначено наблюдение с утверждением нового временного управляющего, которым стал Валерий Таляровский из СРО арбитражных управляющих «Межрегиональный центр экспертов и профессиональных управляющих».\n\nВ октябре 2023 года российское подразделение Google было признано банкротом. На тот момент Таляровский говорил, что размер требований кредиторов компании составил около 54 млрд рублей. В 2022 году ООО «Гугл» получило выручку в размере 24,17 млрд рублей, тогда как чистый убыток составил 10,2 млрд рублей. В 2023 году выручка была нулевой.\nСуды медийных российских компаний с Google, являющейся владельцем сервиса YouTube, продолжаются с 2020 года. Разбирательства начались после блокировки аккаунтов российских СМИ «в связи с нарушениями законодательства о санкциях и правил торговли». К январю нынешнего года сумма требований 17 российских телеканалов к Google выросла до 1,81 дуодецеллиона рублей (дуодециллион — это единица с 39 нулями).\nУкажите имя пользователя:\n© 1997—2025 Электронное периодическое издание \"3ДНьюс\" | Свидетельство о регистрации СМИ Эл ФС 77-22224\nвыдано Федеральной Службой по надзору за соблюдением законодательства в сфере массовых коммуникаций и охране культурного наследия\nПри цитировании документа ссылка на сайт с указанием автора обязательна.

            "full_content": "Com o marketing de influência projetado para atingir impressionantes 139 bilhões de dólares em investimentos anuais até 2030, uma questão se destaca: como as marcas podem navegar neste vasto oceano de oportunidades e alcançar resultados significativos? \nNohoa Arcanjo, CEO e cofundadora da Creators Platform LLC, trouxe luz a essa questão em sua palestra no Spotlight 2025, evento que celebrou os 20 anos do Olhar Digital, explorando o potencial dos criadores de nicho, da IA (inteligência artificial) e desmistificando a ideia de que o marketing de influência ainda é sinônimo de caos.\n“Em 2025, não estamos mais aqui discutindo se o marketing de influência funciona ou não. A ideia é entendermos como vamos destravar a próxima evolução”, afirma Nohoa – destacando a necessidade de evoluir as estratégias e abraçar as mudanças do mercado.\nEnquanto o Brasil ostenta 20 milhões de criadores de conteúdo, apenas 1% deles ultrapassa a marca de 100 mil seguidores. Nohoa argumenta que é preciso ir além dos grandes influenciadores e explorar o vasto potencial dos micro e nano criadores: “O poder está na base. É por isso que estamos falando de micro e nano criadores que conectam melhor e geram mais confiança na audiência”.\nDados apresentados pela especialista reforçam essa tese: criadores de nicho geram cerca de 60% mais engajamento e quatro vezes mais conversão em vendas, além de desfrutarem da confiança de 90% dos consumidores. \nA chave para esse sucesso reside na capacidade desses criadores de construir comunidades engajadas e relevantes. Nohoa destaca a importância de considerar a comunidade como um pilar fundamental da estratégia de influência: “A gente sempre tem a marca, a gente tem os criadores, mas a gente tem que olhar também para as comunidades desses criadores, para as audiências deles”. \nIdentificar valores comuns com a audiência é o que gera influência genuína, permitindo que a marca se torne parte ativa da conversa.\nGerenciar um squad gigante de micro e nano criadores, no entanto, pode ser desafiador, com dificuldades como fragmentação de informações, ROI incerto e complexidade operacional. Nohoa aponta a tecnologia como a solução para superar esses obstáculos: “Tecnologia é o diferencial para organizar toda essa escalada”.\nPlataformas de busca inteligente, métricas em tempo real e inteligência artificial na criação de conteúdo são ferramentas que permitem otimizar o processo e alcançar resultados mais expressivos.\nEm um mundo cada vez mais consciente da importância da diversidade, Nohoa ressalta que abraçar a pluralidade também é uma estratégia inteligente: “Diversidade é sempre uma boa ideia”. Pesquisas mostram que 57% dos consumidores são mais fiéis a marcas que promovem grupos minoritários, e 80% dos consumidores brasileiros acreditam que a comunicação diversa demonstra respeito.\nNohoa vislumbra um futuro onde a chamada influência 4.0 é impulsionada por dados, comunidade, criadores e inteligência artificial: “O marketing de influência hoje, ele é sobre tecnologia. E quem não se adaptar vai ficar invisível de verdade”. \nA IA, por exemplo, surge como ferramenta de otimização de conteúdo, permitindo a criadores e marcas a otimização de conteúdos e alcance de melhores resultados.\nNohoa compartilhou ainda alguns cases de sucesso que ilustram o poder dos criadores de nicho e a importância de estratégias inovadoras. \nGabriel Sérvio é formado em Comunicação Social pelo Centro Universitário Geraldo Di Biase e faz parte da redação do Olhar Digital desde 2020.\nBruno Capozzi é jornalista formado pela Faculdade Cásper Líbero e mestre em Ciências Sociais pela PUC-SP, tendo como foco a pesquisa de redes sociais e tecnologia."

            "full_content": "AP Photo/Michael Probst\nThe last posting on March 6 analyzed the prospects for four of the Magnificent Seven or the “Fab” Seven as some commentators have renamed the group. Let us apply the same approach to Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla. (I added Netflix in the first posting, so we are analyzing the big eight.) The overall stock market is projected to be in a trading range this year. Cycles will be a useful guide in trading the tech heavyweights in 2025.\nAs we can see below, the Amazon cycle bottoms now. This cycle is synchronized with the Amazon seasonal cycle. From March 3 through July 5, this stock has risen over 80% of the time over the last 27 years. This stock is likely to outperform the technology index.\nThis cycle points to a low now.\nMicrosoft cycles are strong until June, but underperformance is likely in the second half of the year. The first half of any year has been bullish. Over the last 38 years, the stock has risen 74% of the time. The cycle is the weakest of the stocks that are under review in the second half of 2025, projecting a weak close to 2025.\nThis cycle advises us to sell in May. \nThe Alphabet monthly rhythm is different from that of most of the other stocks. It traces out a 2025 trading range. There is a low in May followed by a July peak. There is a late October low followed by a strong Q4. Trade the stock.\nThis stock is in a 2025 trading range.\nTesla peaked before the overall technology stock decline. The stock followed its cycle down. The cycle falls into early June and then rallies for most of the rest of the year. June has been the single strongest month in any year, so the dynamic cycle low is reinforced by the low in the seasonal cycle."

            "full_content": "Chegg ha intentato una causa contro Google, accusando il colosso tecnologico di danneggiare il suo business attraverso le anteprime generate dall'intelligenza artificiale. La denuncia è destinata ad alimentare il dibattito sull'uso dell'IA nell'informazione digitale.                            \nChegg, azienda statunitense specializzata in servizi educativi online, ha citato in giudizio Google per le sue anteprime di ricerca basate sull'intelligenza artificiale. L'accusa è che le cosiddette AI Overview stiano erodendo il traffico web tradizionalmente diretto verso gli editori, minacciando l'intero settore dell'editoria digitale.\nLa funzione è stata introdotta lo scorso anno: le AI Overview sono dei riassunti creati con l'intelligenza artificiale generativa che appaiono in cima ai risultati di ricerca e che offrono agli utenti una sintesi delle informazioni richieste. Secondo Chegg, la funzionalità sta causando un calo significativo del traffico verso il proprio sito, poiché gli utenti trovano le risposte sulla pagina di Google senza necessità di visitare altre fonti.\nNathan Schultz, CEO di Chegg, ha espresso preoccupazione per le possibili implicazioni a lungo termine di questa pratica. L'azienda teme che l'approccio di Google possa condurre a un \"ecosistema informativo svuotato\", potenzialmente inaffidabile e \"indegno di fiducia\". La denuncia è destinata ad alimentare un più ampio dibattito sul futuro della ricerca online e sulla distribuzione equa del traffico web.\nGoogle, da parte sua, respinge fermamente le accuse. Un portavoce dell'azienda ha dichiarato a Reuters che le nuove panoramiche sono in realtà pensate per migliorare l'esperienza di ricerca degli utenti, aumentando l'utilizzo del motore e creando nuove opportunità per la scoperta di contenuti. Google sostiene inoltre che le AI Overview stiano contribuendo a indirizzare il traffico verso una gamma più ampia di siti web.\nCon la nuova causa, vengono ancora una volta alimentate le tensioni tra i giganti tech e gli editori di contenuti online. L'avvento dell'intelligenza artificiale generativa sta ridefinendo le dinamiche di accesso all'informazione, portando a galla questioni fondamentali sulla proprietà intellettuale e sulla sostenibilità economica dei produttori di contenuti. L'affidabilità delle tecnologie è un'altra caratteristica al centro del dibattito: nonostante un inizio caratterizzato da risultati talvolta fuorvianti, la tecnologia è notevolmente migliorata nel corso del tempo ma è ancora oggi necessario avere un minimo di dimestichezza per affidarsi esclusivamente alla GenAI, e rimane sempre cruciale verificare le fonti originali per ottenere un quadro completo e accurato delle informazioni. Di seguito l'estratto delle dichiarazioni del CEO di Chegg, relative alla denuncia nei confronti di Google:\nDevi effettuare il login per poter commentare\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSe non sei ancora registrato, puoi farlo attraverso questo \r\n\t\t\t\t\tform.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSe sei già registrato e loggato \r\n\t\t\t\t\tnel sito, puoi inserire il tuo commento. \r\n\t\t\t\t\tSi tenga presente quanto letto nel regolamento, \r\n\t\t\t\t\tnel rispetto del \"quieto vivere\"."

She alleged Google’s actions violated the California Equal Pay Act. She left Google in September 2021.\nAdams said the settlement came after Cantu’s lawyers agreed this month to exclude Black employees from the proposed class, which Google had sought.\nNet settlement proceeds total $20.4 million, after deducting $7 million for legal fees, penalties tied to Cantu’s claim under California’s Private Attorneys General Act, and other costs.\nAdams scheduled a September 11 hearing to consider final settlement approval.\nCantu’s lawyers did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.\nThe case is Cantu v Google LLC et al, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County, No. 21CV392049.\nWas this article valuable?\nThank you!

            "full_content": "Google has filed a lawsuit against a Maryland man, Yaniv Asayag, and several co-conspirators, accusing them of creating fake business listings and fraudulent reviews on Google's services.\nThe company claims the defendants manipulated Google Maps and Google Search to mislead customers and sold consumers' data to third parties.\nThis alleged scheme, which has been ongoing for two years, targeted customers searching for urgent services like locksmiths, HVAC cleaners, and towing companies.\nAccording to the complaint, Asayag, who owns Eagle Locksmith and Eagle Services LLC in Beltsville, Maryland, and his group of collaborators are responsible for generating fake business profiles.\nThe profiles, listed on Google Maps, appeared legitimate, complete with fake reviews, and even manipulated locations.\nAccording to WashingtonTimes, Google's legal team states that Asayag edited business listings 1,034 times, involving at least 149 fake businesses, mostly in the Washington, DC area, but also in other US locations and internationally in Turkey.\nGoogle's complaint emphasizes that the defendants' actions harmed consumers by providing false information about businesses.\nThese misleading profiles made it difficult for potential customers to find trustworthy businesses. Furthermore, after collecting customer data through these fake profiles, Asayag and his group allegedly sold this information as \"leads\" to legitimate businesses.\n/1 Marylander sued by Google, accused of fake review and listing schemeYaniv Asayag, who operates a home improvement company in Beltsville, is accused along with 20 other defendants of making fake listings for sham businesses, plus faux reviews from bogus people the past two…\nHalima DeLaine Prado, Google's General Counsel, said in a statement, \"Fake business listings are prohibited on Google Maps, and we use a range of tools to protect businesses and users.\nToday's litigation builds on our efforts and sends a clear message that impersonation schemes will not be tolerated.\"\nThe lawsuit claims that the fraudulent listings violate Google's terms of service, which require business profiles to be real and reviews to reflect actual customer experiences.\nAdditionally, such schemes could potentially violate US laws like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which governs telemarketing practices, USA Today said.\nLead-generation schemes, though not inherently illegal, become unlawful when they involve deceptive practices, including selling consumer data without consent. This kind of activity can lead to violations of consumer protection laws, especially when businesses use the obtained data for financial gain.\nAsayag's actions reportedly caused significant damage to consumers who were misled by the fake listings.\nGoogle pointed out that these deceptive profiles often led customers to businesses that charged much higher fees than initially promised. Moreover, these businesses could demand additional payments once they arrived on-site, taking advantage of customers' urgent needs.\nTo avoid falling victim to such scams, Google advises consumers to be cautious. It suggests a few \"golden rules\" for avoiding fraudulent listings: slow down, double-check information, and never send personal details or payments unless sure about the legitimacy of a business.\nGoogle has not specified an amount for damages in the lawsuit but aims to protect users from future impersonation schemes.\nOriginally published on vcpost.com"

L'essor des technologies d'IA génératives, telles que ChatGPT, Claude AI, Perplexity, Google Gemini et autres, marque effectivement une révolution dans de nombreux secteurs, notamment la communication et le marketing, la recherche scientifique, l'industrie du divertissement, etc. Leur capacité à produire du texte, des images, de la musique, et même du code informatique suscite à la fois fascination et préoccupations.\nOn s'interroge de plus en plus sur l'authenticité et la qualité des contenus diffusés : sont-ils générés par l'IA ou créés par un humain ? C’est dans ce contexte que les détecteurs de textes IA sont d'une importance croissante. Dès lors, de nombreuses solutions ont vu le jour, avec pour objectif de préserver la crédibilité des contenus en ligne et permettre aux utilisateurs de distinguer clairement ce qui est issu d’un algorithme de ce qui relève de la création humaine.\nCependant, la course entre les outils de génération et de détection ne cesse de s’intensifier, rendant le défi d’autant plus ardu. Découvrons ensemble les meilleurs détecteurs de textes générés par l'IA disponibles aujourd'hui sur le marché.\nLes détecteurs de textes IA sont des outils conçus pour évaluer un écrit et déterminer s'il a été généré par une intelligence artificielle ou rédigé par un être humain. Ils sont souvent disponibles sous forme de logiciels ou de services en ligne.\nCes outils intelligents fonctionnent généralement en comparant le contenu fourni à une vaste base de données de textes écrits par des humains. Ils sont formés pour reconnaître les caractéristiques des écrits réels et les opposer à celles des textes produits par des IA. Lorsqu'un texte est analysé, l'utilitaire fournit un résultat sous forme de pourcentage qui indique la probabilité que le texte a été généré par une IA. Par exemple, un pourcentage inférieur à 5 % signifie que la prose est probablement d'origine humaine.\nSur quillbot.com vous pouvez également procéder à la détection de textes générés par IA.© Capture d'écran.\nSur quillbot.com vous pouvez également procéder à la détection de textes générés par IA.\nCependant, la précision de ces outils varie. Plusieurs éléments, dont la langue du texte, entrent en facteur pour déterminer leur efficacité. Par exemple, un texte rédigé dans une langue moins couramment analysée par l'outil ou un contenu utilisant un style d'écriture sophistiqué peut rendre la détection plus difficile. Il peut arriver qu'un texte généré artificiellement échappe à la détection. À l'inverse, certains détecteurs peuvent marquer à tort un texte rédigé par un humain comme étant généré par une intelligence artificielle.\nCela se produit souvent lorsque le texte est simple de structure ou contient un vocabulaire peu varié. De plus, certaines limitations technologiques des algorithmes peuvent conduire à des erreurs de classification.\nPour faire face à ces défis, les développeurs mettent régulièrement à jour leurs algorithmes pour les rendre plus précis et adaptés à l’évolution des technologies, notamment lorsqu'on sait que les générateurs de contenu, comme ChatGPT, s'améliorent constamment.\nIl existe de nombreuses solutions en ligne pour détecter les textes générés par IA comme GPTzero qui a parfaitement analysé notre texte rédigé par Perplexity.© Capture d'écran.\nIl existe de nombreuses solutions en ligne pour détecter les textes générés par IA comme GPTzero qui a parfaitement analysé notre texte rédigé par Perplexity.\nConçu et développé en France, Lucide IA permet d’analyser en profondeur l’origine des textes afin de déterminer s’ils ont été rédigés par un humain, une intelligence artificielle ou issus d’un plagiat. Son approche unique repose sur une analyse fine des contenus. Il ne se contente pas d’identifier la présence d’éléments issus de l’IA ; il permet aussi de distinguer les productions artificielles de qualité de celles qui le sont moins, et d'identifier les rédactions offshore et les écrits de professionnels expérimentés.\nL’outil est capable d’analyser des textes sous différentes formes, y compris des fichiers PDF, Word et Open Office, et procède à une vérification page par page afin d’assurer une analyse détaillée et fiable. En complément, il intègre un module de lutte contre le plagiat. Il identifie les passages dupliqués et les éventuelles reprises de textes existants, permettant ainsi d’anticiper tout risque de contenu non original. Chaque rapport d’analyse est accompagné d’une interprétation personnalisée pour faciliter la compréhension des résultats et la prise de décision.\nLucide IA est disponible sous la forme d’un service en ligne, accessible directement depuis un navigateur web. Son utilisation est soumise à un abonnement ou à l’achat d’un pack prépayé. Pour les entreprises et les institutions souhaitant intégrer cette technologie à leurs propres systèmes, Lucide IA propose également une API dédiée.\nLucide IA est un service de détection de plagiat made in France qui permet d'identifier avec précision l’origine d’un contenu textuel, de détecter l'utilisation de l'IA et d'interpréter la qualité rédactionnelle d’un texte.\nWinston AI est destiné principalement aux entreprises, chercheurs, journalistes et professionnels de l’édition. Il permet d’assurer l’intégrité des contenus en détectant à la fois le plagiat et les textes produits par des modèles d’IA, tels que ChatGPT, GPT-4, Google Gemini et autres.\nCet outil de détection avancé est en mesure d'analyser des sources variées aux formats DOCX, PNG et JPG. Il propose aussi d’extraire du texte à partir d’images ou de documents numérisés grâce à l'intégration de la technologie de reconnaissance optique de caractères (OCR). De plus, il intègre une fonctionnalité de détection de plagiat qui procède à la comparaison des écrits à une vaste base de données pour identifier d’éventuels contenus dupliqués.\nNotre texte généré à 100 % par une IA (Perplexity) est correctement détecté.© Capture d'écran\nNotre texte généré à 100 % par une IA (Perplexity) est correctement détecté.\nL'outil est par ailleurs capable d'identifier les techniques de contournement souvent utilisées pour masquer l’origine des textes générés par IA. Il peut ainsi repérer des contenus paraphrasés par des outils comme Quillbot, ou encore ceux modifiés par des “humaniseurs”, des logiciels conçus pour rendre un texte IA plus naturel et difficile à détecter. Et pour faciliter l'archivage et le partage des résultats d'analyse, Winston AI permet de générer un rapport détaillé, facilement imprimable ou exportable.\nAu-delà de la simple analyse, ce détecteur IA propose une plateforme de gestion des documents, idéale pour organiser, classer et retrouver rapidement les fichiers analysés. Grâce à un système d’étiquetage, chaque document peut être associé à un titre, un auteur ou une catégorie spécifique.\nWinston AI est accessible directement depuis un navigateur, sans nécessité d’installation. Une version de démonstration gratuite permet d’explorer ses fonctionnalités avec 2000 crédits offerts pour un essai de 14 jours. Pour les utilisateurs ayant des besoins plus avancés, Winston AI met à disposition plusieurs forfaits payants. L’outil propose aussi une extension Chrome, parfaite pour détecter en temps réel les contenus IA générés lors de la navigation sur le web.\nAvec un taux de précision de 99,98 %, Winston AI s'est imposé comme l'un des outils les plus fiables pour analyser et évaluer si un texte a été rédigé par une IA ou par un être humain.\nPlagiarism Check est capable d'identifier le contenu généré par l’intelligence artificielle avec une précision de 99 %. Il peut faire la distinction entre un texte écrit par un humain et un contenu produit par des modèles IA avancés comme ChatGPT, GPT-4 et Google Gemini.\nContrairement aux méthodes classiques de détection du plagiat, Plagiarism Check est en mesure d’identifier des similitudes exactes ou partielles, même lorsque le texte a été modifié ou paraphrasé. Il compare les textes soumis à diverses bases de données, incluant des publications en ligne, des articles scientifiques et d’autres sources académiques ou grand public. Il repère par ailleurs les réarrangements syntaxiques, les substitutions de mots ou toute autre technique utilisée pour masquer un plagiat.\nAprès chaque analyse, ce générateur IA crée un rapport détaillé et téléchargeable, offrant une vue claire sur les similitudes détectées et la probabilité qu’un texte ait été produit par une IA. Les analyses sont effectuées en toute sécurité, sans risque de divulgation des données traitées.\nDisponible directement en ligne, Plagiarism Check peut être utilisé depuis n’importe quel appareil connecté à Internet, sans installation préalable. Ce service est payant, mais propose une version de démonstration gratuite afin de tester ses fonctionnalités avant de souscrire un abonnement.\nIl s'intègre avec de nombreuses plateformes éducatives populaires, telles que Canvas, Google Classroom, Brightspace, Populi, Moodle, Schoology et BlackBoard, pour permettre aux enseignants et étudiants d’effectuer leurs vérifications directement depuis ces plateformes. Pour encore plus de flexibilité, une extension pour Google Docs est disponible.\nPlagiarism Check est un service précieux pour toute personne souhaitant s'assurer de l'intégrité de ses écrits et éviter le plagiat, que ce soit dans un cadre académique, professionnel ou créatif.\nSmodin détecte les contenus générés par l’IA à l’aide d’un algorithme avancé et une vaste base de données linguistiques. Son algorithme est conçu pour traquer les caractéristiques spécifiques des textes produits par IA, même lorsqu’ils sont mélangés avec du contenu rédigé par un humain. Il maintient un taux de précision de 91 % pour l’identification des contenus générés par IA, et de 99 % pour les textes écrits par un humain. Aucune création de compte n’est requise pour effectuer une vérification.\n100 % de réussite pour Smodin qui analyse notre texte 100 % IA.© Capture d'écran.\n100 % de réussite pour Smodin qui analyse notre texte 100 % IA.\nL’outil génère ensuite un rapport détaillé indiquant les sections du texte potentiellement produites par IA, ainsi que les critères expliquant cette détection. Cela permet non seulement de confirmer l’authenticité d’un document, mais aussi de comprendre comment l’intelligence artificielle influence la rédaction des contenus.\nSmodin est capable de traiter divers types de fichiers aux formats DOC, DOCX, PDF, XLS et CSV rédigés en plus de 100 langues, y compris le français. Son algorithme prend en compte différents styles d’écriture, ce qui améliore la fiabilité des analyses et octroie des résultats plus précis, quel que soit le type de texte soumis à la vérification.\nCe service est entièrement basé en ligne. Il fonctionne aussi bien sur tout appareil connecté à Internet, sans qu’il soit nécessaire d’installer un logiciel supplémentaire. Une version gratuite limitée de Smodin est proposée avec cinq analyses par semaine. Pour ceux qui ont besoin d’un accès illimité, il est possible de s'abonner à une version Premium.\nSmodin est un outil précieux pour ceux qui cherchent à maintenir un style d'écriture naturel tout en restant à l'abri des biais ou des styles d'écriture propres aux IA génératives."

There’s the adrenaline rush, yet a feeling of being lost, given so many unknowns. Something fundamental, like deciding between a sole proprietorship that requires minimal paperwork or going for a more structured LLC, can feel overwhelming. If you register an LLC, choosing between different LLC filing companies becomes the next big decision.\nWhen researching registering an LLC, I remember being stretched between decoding legal jargon, figuring out state requirements, and wrapping my head around the endless LLC filing companies that came up on a Google Search. Like anyone else who starts a company, I wanted the best LLC filing company for my business. So, I spent a lot of time exploring options minutely, surfing different websites, and analyzing for reviews before making any choice.\nHaving gone through the (rather lengthy) process, I’ve compiled a list of the top LLC filing companies to help entrepreneurs make an informed choice without spending as much time as I had to. In this blog, I’ll share my top recommendations for the best LLC filing companies,\nAn LLC filing company provides services to help entrepreneurs form a Limited Liability Company (LLC). This includes support like simplifying the registration process, ensuring the meeting of state requirements, filing the necessary documents, and staying compliant with ongoing obligations. \nWhy go with LLC filing companies and not do it yourself? I’ve figured getting external help handling the paperwork to register the business is a good idea because the initial few days in any entrepreneurial journey are taxing. It doesn’t hurt to reserve focus at that time on more strategic pursuits to grow the business. You don’t want to be circling a mountain of paperwork that you don’t want to make errors in, right? On that note, let me take you through my top picks.\n9 templates to help you brainstorm a business name, develop your business plan, and pitch your idea to investors. \nAll fields are required.\nClick this link to access this resource at any time.\nZenBusiness is one of the leading LLC filing companies in the United States. They offer an easy, all-in-one platform to help business owners with all the tools and support they need to start, run, and grow a successful business. The company offers comprehensive packages that include business name availability searches, document filing, registered agent services, and more.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.8/5 (based on over 19,233 reviews).\nBest For: Individuals looking for budget-friendly, reliable services.\nPricing Plans: Currently. they’re offering 3 annual packages for LLC filing: Starter($0 + state fees), Pro ($169 + state fees), Premium ($250 + state fees),\nPotential Drawback(s): A close study of their reviews shows they require US addresses to use the services — a fact that isn’t communicated before signing up. So, if you’re not US-based, this might be a drawback you might want to consider.\nBizee is a business formation and registered agent company. It is one of the market's most affordable LLC formation options and offers a full suite of formation, compliance, and filing services for businesses across all 50 states. It’s essential to note they help with forming LLCs but don’t offer legal advice or other legal services concerning your LLC formation.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.7/5 (based on 20427 reviews)\nBest For: Price-conscious entrepreneurs looking for value-for-money LLC filing services.\nPricing Plans: They’re offering three packages, all with a one-time fee. These include: Basic ($0 + state fees), Standard($199 + state fees), Premium ($299 + state fees),\nPotential Drawback: Bizee might not be the best fit if you’re looking for the smoothest customer service experience. After reading reviews thoroughly, I learned that reaching their customer support isn’t a breeze. Moreover, Bizee’s users often expect to receive more direction than they get.\n9 templates to help you brainstorm a business name, develop your business plan, and pitch your idea to investors. \nAll fields are required.\nClick this link to access this resource at any time.\nFounded in 1996, BizFiling can be regarded as a pioneer of the online incorporation space. In 2002, the company became part of Wolters Kluwer-backed CT Corporation, the industry’s premier legal services brand. They offer various products, services, and tools to support entrepreneurs throughout the life of their business, from setting up to amending documents as needed to stay compliant over time.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.6/5 (based on 94 reviews)\nBest for: Entrepreneurs seeking excellent service and quick response times and are willing to pay a premium for it.\nPricing Plans: They offer three LLC packages with different inclusions. However, they don’t have standard pricing for each package. The base charges vary across states, with the lowest at $99. Additional state fees apply.\nThey may not be the most economical service. Customers have written reviews saying that other filing businesses offer more for the same fee.\nRocket Lawyer combines LLC filing services with access to affordable legal advice. Their offering revolves around helping start a business and retaining a legal expert to answer any questions that arise then or eventually. They thrive on ensuring the law is not out of reach for the ordinary citizen due to costs and complexity, making their service a versatile option for businesses of all sizes.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.6/5 (based on 8831 reviews)\nBest For: Business owners who anticipate needing ongoing legal assistance.\nPricing Plans: They offer two plans: Rocket Legal ($39.99/month) and Rocket Legal+ ($19.99/month). Both plans come with free 7-day trials where you just need to pay the state fees.\nWhile they have two plans, it’s unmistakable that Rocket Legal+ offers the best value for money. What stands out in this plan is the following:\nPotential Drawback: It appears they lack transparency about their pricing structure. I’ve found reviews with customers complaining about their “free advertisement.” They mentioned that once you get to the end of the process, they ask you to pay up to proceed. Another one complained about their package inclusions, for instance, Q&A with lawyers, which hands out no concrete answers but lawyer referrals. So, I’d take their freebies with a pinch of salt.\nSwyft Filings is an incorporation service built on convenience. They’ve designed their offering to help entrepreneurs get their company up and running as quickly, efficiently, and affordably as possible with expert help on board.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.6/5 (based on 6866 reviews)\nBest For: Entrepreneurs looking for a simplified solution with expert help when starting up.\nPricing Plans: Currently. they’re offering 3 annual packages: Basic ($0 + state fees), Standard ($199 + state fees), Premium ($299 + state fees),\nPotential Drawback(s): It would be their non-transparent cancellation options. I’d read reviews of some customers complaining that they were signed up for services they didn’t opt for on a subscription basis. When they went out to cancel, it was a taxing process with little clarity and support to stop the recurring fees.\nDoola is a one-stop shop built to help entrepreneurs launch, maintain, and grow their LLCs in the United States, regardless of where they are based worldwide. They offer a comprehensive suite of services, from business formation to bookkeeping and tax filings.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.5/5 (based on 1723 reviews)\nBest For: Non-US-based entrepreneurs looking to register and grow an LLC in the US.\nPricing Plans: Currently they’re offering 3 annual packages: Starter ($297 + state fees), Total Compliance ($1999 + state fees), and Total Compliance Max ($2999 + state fees).\nPotential Drawback: I’ve noticed several customers express concern over their communication flow. Their dashboard isn’t seemingly intuitive, and contacting the company doesn’t yield satisfactory responses speedily.\n9 templates to help you brainstorm a business name, develop your business plan, and pitch your idea to investors. \nAll fields are required.\nClick this link to access this resource at any time.\nTrustpilot Score: 2.9/5 (based on 111 reviews), Rated 4.7 / 5 stars by 1295 clients on Google\nNorthwest Registered Agent is renowned for its registered agent services and its suite of helpful offerings, including crafting the operating agreement, arranging business addresses, and mail forwarding. The company prioritizes data security and offers personalized service.\nBest For: Entrepreneurs seeking personalized assistance and keeping their address off their filings.\nPricing Plans: Currently, they’ve got a single plan called The Northwest LLC ($39 + State Fees).\nPotential Drawback: Their response time appears slow. A frustrated user complained that their query went unanswered for 24 hours. The same user also complained that it takes longer than the standard time to apply for an EIN.\nEstablished in 2001, LegalZoom is a well-established name in business formation, with offices in Los Angeles, Austin, and the Bay Area. They offer a wide range of legal services in addition to LLC filings. Interestingly, they’ve helped over 4 million entrepreneurs turn ideas into businesses, which I think talks a lot about their credibility.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.4/5 (Based on 11751 reviews)\nBest For: Entrepreneurs who want a one-stop shop for business and legal needs.\nPricing Plans: Currently, they’ve got three packages to choose from: Basic ($0 + state fees), Pro ($224 + state fees), Premium ($269 + state fees).\nI’ve noticed users complain about their program/menu. A disappointed user mentioned that it was dysfunctional and caused an enormous waste of time. The customer service rep was patient and helped, but the time they took to resolve the query was putting off.\nTailor Brands is a unique LLC filing service that offers end-to-end services in the truest sense. Their offerings cover the needs of those just getting started and those already in business with a revolutionary business-building platform focused on branding activities.\nTrustpilot Score: 4.4/5 (based on 9095 reviews)\nBest For: Entrepreneurs looking for a one-stop shop to register their LLC and get basic branding activities moving.\nPricing Plans: Currently they’re offering 3 annual packages: Starter($0 + state fees), Pro ($169 + state fees), Premium ($250 + state fees).\nPotential Drawback: Some customers complained that the company is highly focused on upselling and little concerned about what customers need. Their commitment and quality of customer support can also be put off.\nResearching the best LLC filing companies out there has been an eye-opening experience. Firstly, I’ve realized that “free” rarely is as good as it sounds. When you go for the cheapest bet, you could find yourself paying for essential add-ons and sneaky hidden costs that quickly add up if you don’t read the fine print.\nI’ve also learned that no one-size-fits-all best LLC business filing solution exists. What you choose should depend on your business needs (and budget). Some entrepreneurs might need essential filing support, while others may prefer to sign up for ongoing compliance support, legal assistance, or branding tools. The best approach is to take your time and weigh your options before committing to any service. Doing this can save you quite a bit of money and frustration down the road.\nHaving said all this, I’d like to close on an important note. Remember: Registering your business is an important step — but it’s just a step. Your real work is going to start after this. On that note, happy filing and focusing on what truly matters: growing your business.\n9 templates to help you brainstorm a business name, develop your business plan, and pitch your idea to investors. \nAll fields are required.\nClick this link to access this resource at any time.\n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 19, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 14, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 12, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 11, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 10, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 07, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 07, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 06, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Mar 03, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \n\n                      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    Feb 27, 2025\n  \n\n\n                    \nGet expert sales tips straight to your inbox, and become a better seller.

            "full_content": "digital world, life skills, point of views & lifestyle\nGoogle’s $23 billion acquisition of Wiz—the largest in its history—signals a seismic shift in cloud security. Announced earlier, Google Wiz acquisition aims to transform Google’s multicloud security powerhouse, leveraging Wiz’s industry-leading tools for vulnerability detection, posture management, and compliance automation. But what does this mean for enterprises juggling AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud? How will Wiz’s technology reshape the fight against cyber threats? Here’s an in-depth look at five bold strategies to dominate multicloud security with Wiz acquisition.\nEnterprises using AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud often struggle with siloed security tools, creating blind spots for misconfigurations (e.g., exposed S3 buckets, unsecured APIs).\n—————-Recommendations, Please continue reading below—————- \nHighly rated daily-life products at low prices Shop Now\nFrom bedding to office furniture and supplies, from kitchen accessories to health & fitness, from storage to travel bags, the amazon basics provides hundreds of daily use products at amazingly low prices with having highly rated consumers feedback. Click here to learn more >>>\nImpact: Reduces remediation time by 70%, per Wiz’s pre-acquisition case studies.\nLegacy tools scan each cloud separately, delaying responses to critical vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4j, zero-days).\nExample: A financial firm using AWS and Google Cloud detected 1,200 exposed secrets in 48 hours post-Wiz integration.\nTeams drown in thousands of generic alerts while missing sophisticated threats.\nImpact: Reduces false positives by 60% and accelerates threat response by 3x.\nLeverage the power of AI to build a passive income stream that works for you 24/7.

Wiz offers broader coverage, but AWS Security Hub integrates more tightly with services like GuardDuty and Inspector.\nQ: How do I maintain compliance across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud?\nA:\nQ: Does Wiz support real-time compliance checks?\nA: Yes. Wiz auto-scans for deviations (e.g., unencrypted Azure SQL databases) and flags them in dashboards.\nQ: What’s new in Google Cloud security post-Wiz acquisition?\nA: Key 2025 updates include:\nQ: Will Wiz features cost extra for Google Cloud users?\nA: Basic Wiz tools (CSPM, vulnerability scanning) will bundle with Enterprise-tier subscriptions. Advanced features (attack path simulation, secrets management) may require add-ons.\nQ: How much does Wiz cost for multicloud environments?\nA: Pricing is based on:\nQ: Is Wiz cheaper than managing multiple tools?\nA: Yes. For example:\nQ: Are there hidden costs?\nA: Potential add-ons:\nGoogle’s Wiz play mirrors Microsoft’s GitHub+Semmle and AWS’s Wickr buys, but with a multicloud edge. Expect:\nBottom line: Wiz gives Google the arsenal to lead the multicloud security war—but only time will tell if enterprises rally behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOwala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw for Sports, Travel, and School BPA-Free Sports Water Bottle, 24 oz, Denim4.7 out of 5 stars(66564) Available for Amazon Prime 11% Off $29.99 $26.50"

            "full_content": "Une des grandes nouveautés de l’architecture RDNA 4 présente dans les nouvelles cartes graphiques AMD RX 9070 / XT est l’arrivée tant attendue du FSR 4. La nouvelle version de la solution d’upscaling d’AMD exploite enfin l’intelligence artificielle pour offrir en théorie une bien meilleure qualité d’image que la précédente version.\nLes promesses du constructeur sont là : moins d’artefacts, moins de ghosting et une meilleure stabilité de l’image au global, qu’il s’agisse de scènes fixes ou en mouvement. Mais comme il ne faut prendre pour argent comptant ce type d’annonce, des premiers tests ont pu nous montrer l’étendue des progrès d’AMD avec cette mise à jour majeur.\nComme à l’accoutumée, les experts de Digital Foundry qui ont communiqué leurs impressions sur cette nouvelle version du FSR. En exploitant pour les nouveaux accélérateurs IA des cartes graphiques RX 9000, le FSR 4 peut effectuer une meilleure reconstruction d’image, tout du moins sur le papier.\n Lien YouTube S’abonner à Frandroid \n                Ce contenu est bloqué car vous n’avez pas accepté les cookies et autres traceurs.

La qualité d’image fait un sérieux bond en avant.\nGlobalement, c’est aussi le niveau de détail des textures qui est bien mieux rendu avec le FSR 4, notamment grâce à un bien meilleur anti-aliasing. L’image semble bien plus nette, notamment en mouvement avec une sérieuse réduction des effets de ghosting et un rendu bien moins pixellisé.\nIl est possible de s’en rendre compte dès la scène d’introduction de Ratchet & Clank : Rift Apart : la fourrure de Ratchet ne scintille plus, tout comme le tapis rouge sur lequel il se tient, et les détails métalliques du robot Clank sont bien plus nets. De même, l’herbe n’a plus le rendu « peinture » qu’elle avait avec le FSR 3.\nPour Digital Foundry et selon nos propres observations, la qualité d’image est ainsi similaire au DLSS dans sa version CNN. Pour rappel, le DLSS 4 a apporté les améliorations du modèle Transformer avec une qualité d’image franchement impressionnante.\nAMD ne peut pas rivaliser avec ce nouveau modèle, mais surpasse à plusieurs égards le DLSS CNN, notamment sur le niveau de détail et la qualité de l’anti-aliasing.\nNous avons testé les performances des deux versions du FSR face au DLSS et ses deux modèles au sein de Ratchet & Clank : Rift Apart. Sans surprise, le FSR 4 est plus gourmand que le FSR 3 avec des performances en baisse de 8 à 9% sur ce titre.\nPar rapport au DLSS en version CNN (l’ancien modèle utilisé par Nvidia), les performances sont en nette baisse, entre 16 et 17%. Le niveau de performance du FSR 4 est similaire à celui du DLSS intégrant le modèle Transformer, légèrement inférieur de 4% en moyenne selon les tests.\nIl s’agit ici d’une première version et gageons que AMD améliorera à la fois la qualité d’image de sa solution, mais aussi ses performances.

Anne Rice, of course, was the author behind Interview With The Vampire and the Mayfair Witches novels that are now streaming hits on AMC and Netflix. The rights to the Rice estate's literary properties are controlled by Dinner Partners LLC, a production company owned and operated by the New York Times bestselling novelists Christopher Rice, son of Anne Rice, and Eric Shaw Quinn, who is also represented by InkWell Management and Literate. Rice and Quinn will serve as executive producers on all projects.\nThe works of Anne Rice, who passed away at the age of 80 in 2021, have a long and successful history of series and film adaptations. She also wrote non-supernatural and erotic novels under the names Anne Rampling and A.N. Roquelaure. Her debut novel, Interview with the Vampire, was published in 1976 and adapted into the acclaimed 1994 film.  In 2020, AMC Networks acquired the rights to The Vampire Chronicles and The Lives of the Mayfair Witches books. Both TV series adaptations and the upcoming The Talamasca spinoff are executive produced by Christopher Rice and the late Anne Rice, who gets a posthumous credit.\nThe library of intellectual property held by the estate also includes beloved franchises and popular works, such as the Ramses The Damned series, which updated The Mummy mythos, The Wolf Gift Chronicles series, The Songs Of The Seraphim series, The Sleeping Beauty series, and standalone titles such as The Feast Of All Saints, Servant Of The Bones, among other published, unpublished, and archival works. All these series will be on the table for multimedia projects under the new deal.\n\"We are thrilled to be working with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn, as the stewards of Anne Rice's estate, to create new projects and opportunities that will honor her incredible contributions to storytelling and enthrall her fans all over the world for years to come.\" said the InkWell Management and Literate partners in a statement.\n\"Anne Rice's storytelling has captivated readers for decades. We are committed to preserving her legacy and ensuring that her unparalleled body of work continues to inspire, enthrall, and reach new audiences around the world,\" said InkWell Management co-founder Michael V. Carlisle. Literate partner Elizabeth Newman said, \"The potential for further adaptation is exciting.  Anne Rice's lush and imaginative writing offers a rich reservoir of cinematic, compelling material.\"\nDinner Partners also controls rights to the individual novels written by Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn, including Rice's gothic bestseller A Density of Souls, his #1 Amazon bestselling Burning Girl series, along with Quinn's comic novel Say Uncle, his controversial historical saga The Prince's Psalm and multiple other works from both authors. Dinner Partners also produces The TDPS Network at TheDinnerPartyShow.com, including podcasts The Dinner Party Show and TDPS Presents Christopher & Eric, which played a major role in solving the brutal cold case murder of gay adult film actor William Arnold Newton.\n\"We are over the moon to be working with InkWell Management and Literate,\" said Rice and Quinn, \"After her long-standing relationship with Elizabeth Newman, we're certain Anne would be grateful to know she's part of the Literate family. We know we are.  Elizabeth has not only been a strong advocate for all of our writing in the past but was one of Anne's most trusted partners during her lifetime. Our team at InkWell Management– spearheaded by Michael V. Carlisle and David Forrer – and their strong track record in global publishing, intellectual property licensing, and brand-building will ensure Anne's work will continue to inspire readers for generations.\"\nDinner Partners has announced plans to produce a Celebration of Life event honoring Anne Rice, to be held on November 1st, 2025, in New Orleans, Rice's home and the setting of many of her books.\nInterview with the Vampire and Mayfair Witches are streaming on AMC+.\nEnjoyed this?

            "full_content": "Only 5% of jobs allow you to work from any location, even when classified as remote\nDid you know that although remote work remains a popular work model, only 5% of roles allow employees to work from anywhere in the world? That’s what MyPerfectResume, sister site to FlexJobs, discovered recently in their study of remote job postings in late 2024, according to information shared via email.\nBut unfortunately for many professionals, the supply of work-from-anywhere remote jobs does not match the demand. Immediately after the election in November, digital nomad related searches and Google searches for moving abroad spiked, New York Times reported, signaling a renewed interest in being able to work freely from anywhere around the world. Additionally, Google Trends data shows that the level of interest in \"work from anywhere\" has increased by 10 points over the past year.\nA 2024 FlexJobs survey of 3,000 U.S. workers shared in their Workforce Wellness Report revealed that “over half (58%) of people said they would accept a pay cut for the option to work from anywhere. Of these respondents, 31% would take a salary decrease of 5%, and 19% were willing to accept up to a 10% pay cut,” the report continued.\n\"For the option to work-from-anywhere, workers said they’d also accept:\nBut what is driving this demand? Why do professionals want the freedom to work remotely from any country?\nObvious pointers include politics and other nation-specific issues that are at variance with the values and beliefs of many workers. But other likely drivers influencing this demand include the desire for enhanced wellbeing and work-life balance, the unstable nature of the economy and high cost of living in one’s main country of residence, and simply having unlimited freedom to live one’s ideal lifestyle without restrictions.\nHowever, as noted earlier, work-from-anywhere jobs only account for a mere 5% of the job market because most remote roles require you to be present in one specific location. Although at first glance, it shouldn’t matter where you work when remote as long as you get the job done, to some employers, your location actually does matter for the following reasons, according to FlexJobs:\nOther factors can include companies wanting to avoid HR and labor law complications, as well as restrictions imposed that affect and are related to U.S. trade embargoes, security, and financial sanctions and tariffs, as Zapier was keen to mention in their list of countries where they do not hire.\nSo how do you find remote jobs that are remote in every sense of the word? Where can you find a role or a company that doesn’t require its employees to all be in a specific location? Thankfully, there are employers who do actually hire from anywhere in the world.\nTake Invisible Technologies, for example. At the time of writing, they’re currently hiring for an operations manager role, which is classified as “worldwide remote” in the listing. They also have other remote jobs, although these appear to be state-specific. However, the company states on their careers pages that they are happy to answer location-related questions once the recruitment ball starts rolling.\nBelow are other employers (including Invisible Technologies) identified by FlexJobs as having the largest number of work-from-anywhere remote jobs in recent months:\nOther companies, in a separate list by Zapier, include:\nTo find other employers that fit this category, you could run a Google search on “companies hiring work from anywhere jobs.” You could also browse job boards like FlexJobs, Working Nomads, and We Work Remotely. Finally, if you’re a knowledge worker, working in your profession as a freelancer gives you ultimate location freedom, so consider opting for an independent career path so you can continue collaborating with companies while working from any location.\nInterest in working from anywhere in the world has surged over the past year, and spiked more ... More significantly post-election\nStart your remote work adventure across the world today and take your job anywhere by including these employers as part of your remote job search strategy."

Al fin y al cabo es un teléfono de poco más de 500 euros.Por otro lado, el iPhone 16e de Apple es la opción ideal para todo aficionado a los productos de Apple. Un diseño minimalista y elegante, sobrio, con un hardware muy potente y soporte para Apple Intelligence.

Эти акты признали незаконным перечисление в адрес компании дочерним ООО «Гугл» в 2021 году около 9,5 миллиарда рублей в виде дивидендов, а также выплату 500 миллионов рублей налогов на эту сумму.\nИз данных картотеки арбитражных дел, которые передаёт РИА «Новости», следует, что кассационная жалоба иностранной компании поступила в Верховный суд РФ 14 марта. Судьи, в соответствии с законодательством, имеют право рассматривать её в течение двух месяцев, прежде чем она будет распределена и заслушана.\nПримечательно, что ранее суды признали незаконными отчисления российским подразделениям Google International почти 9,5 миллиарда рублей в виде дивидендов, а также выплаты около 500 миллионов рублей налогов. Все сделки были признаны недействительными, после чего с организации было взыскано 10 миллиардов рублей в конкурсную массу по просьбе конкурсного управляющего «Гугла» Валерия Таляровского.\nТогда Таляровский в подтверждение своих слов уточнил, что Google International, единственный участник «Гугла», в декабре 2020 года распределил до 10 миллиардов рублей прибыли «дочки» за 2015-2017 годы. В декабре 2021 года было выплачено около 128,7 миллиона долларов (примерно 9,5 миллиарда рублей на тот момент) в виде дивидендов. Кроме того, «Гугл» уплатил 500 миллионов рублей в бюджет в качестве налога на прибыль организаций с доходов, полученных в виде дивидендов иностранным организациям.\nВ свою очередь, представители Google International заявили, что на момент выплаты дивидендов на счетах компании было 19 миллиардов рублей, а после выплат осталось еще 14 миллиардов. Кроме того, в тот период «Гугл» приносил значительный доход, который к четвертому кварталу 2021 года составил 47,5 миллиарда рублей. Таким образом, невозможно говорить ни о неплатежеспособности «Гугла», ни о противоправности действий его участника.\nРанее московский суд оштрафовал экс-главу российской «дочки» Google Юлию Соловьёву на 232 млн. Кроме того, было арестовано её имущество, среди которого участок земли, жилой дом в Московской области и мотоцикл BMW.\nShutterstock / FOTODOM / Sundry Photography"

            "full_content": "Forward-looking: Silicon photonics could provide an alternative solution to the growing pains of purely silicon-based chips in computing and data transmission. Light-based CPUs are likely still a long way off, but connectivity is improving fast thanks to Google's X and other startup-focused ventures. \nGoogle's X company is working on the next generation of Taara, a silicon photonics technology designed to bring fast broadband speeds to some underdeveloped areas of the world. According to statements by Taara general manager Mahesh Krishnaswamy, this light-based solution could offer unprecedented connectivity opportunities in any part of the world – and beyond.\nProject Taara makes use of some of the technologies developed by Loon LLC, the Alphabet subsidiary that was working on internet access for rural areas until 2021. As a part of Google's X initiative, Taara is tasked with building prototypes of \"moonshot technologies\" that can bring real change while turning into a tenable business prospect.\nThe newly introduced Taara chip is a complete redesign of the organization's first-gen technology. Taara Lightbridge units are as big as traffic lights, Krishnaswamy explained, and they use a complex mechanical contraption made of mirrors, sensors, and other hardware components to physically steer light. When two Taara Lightbridge units finally \"connect,\" light beams create a stable link that can be used to transmit digital data.\nA Taara Lightbridge unit can be installed in hours instead of the days, months, or even years required to lay a proper fiber-based optical network. The process should become even easier with the Taara chip as Google's silicon photonics technology is now abandoning most mechanical components for a new solid-state solution.\nThanks to an innovative optical phased array, light beams can now be steered with \"extraordinary\" precision to create a reliable data link. Taara chip's hardware components are much simplified, Google said, with software algorithms doing the bulk of the work required to steer, track, and correct light beams. A single Taara chip includes hundreds of software-controlled tiny light emitters.\nGoogle tested the new Taara chips at its Moonshot Factory labs, achieving speeds of 10 Gbps over distances of 1 km in an outdoor environment. Google said this represents a record-breaking result for data transmission over silicon photonics chips, and the team is now working to expand the chip's capacity, packing thousands of light emitters at once.\nKrishnaswamy is enthusiastic about the potential applications of the new Taara technology. Solid-state silicon photonics can reduce the cost of internet connectivity in a drastic way, and the entire industry could change through a \"network\" effect. \"Using chips deployed in a global mesh network, we see opportunities to bring high-speed internet to underserved regions, rethink the way data centers are built and operated, enable faster, create safer communication for autonomous vehicles, and so much more. The possibilities are as boundless as light itself,\" Taara's manager said.\nThe organization plans to launch a new product based on the Taara chip sometime in 2026. Researchers and other innovators interested in the technology can get in touch with Taara's team via mail.\n\nAbout\nEthics Statement\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nManage Ad Consent\n\nTECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers\nTechSpot is a registered trademark and may not be used by third parties \n without express written permission.\nTechSpot is represented by Future PLC.

            "full_content": "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\nLast week, Akamai, a cloud computing company with a popular content-delivery network product, reported solid earnings that beat expectations. Soon after, its stock plunged by more than 20 percent and stayed there. What were investors so worried about? They were concerned, it turns out, about Akamai’s relationship with a much better-known company: TikTok. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, is one of Akamai’s biggest customers. One concern is that TikTok is working to become less reliant on contractors like Akamai. Another is weirder and bigger: TikTok is still sort of illegal, and working with TikTok is still sort of against the law.\nTo recap as quickly as possible: During his last term as president, Donald Trump helped lead a campaign to ban TikTok, starting with executive orders and ending during the Biden administration with a bipartisan law. Trump flipped on the issue during the 2024 campaign, but the law still stands. That is a problem for companies like Apple and Google, which host TikTok in their app stores and are directly implicated in the law as written. It’s also a problem for firms like Akamai, which provide infrastructure services that keep TikTok working. Trump issued an executive order asserting, with unclear authority, that the ban was paused, and the Justice Department has been offering TikTok’s partners assurances that they won’t be prosecuted.\nThis was enough to convince Akamai — with Oracle, Apple, Google, and others — to help restore TikTok, but the app and its partners are now stuck in a sort of legalish limbo. Is the plan for Vice-President J.D. Vance to oversee a sale? To just leave things as is and muddle along? To contrive some other arrangement and simply insist that it meets the law’s requirements? Apple and Google have stayed conspicuously quiet on the situation, successfully avoiding confrontation with the administration. Akamai, however, disclosed its risks — and to a great extent, theirs — in an annual report to the SEC. While “the Attorney General has since determined that our provision of services to this customer has not violated the law and that we can continue providing services,” the company said, “[i]t is difficult to predict whether the passed legislation will ultimately be enforced and whether any future judicial challenges brought against the executive order will be successful.” The company goes on:\nEven though President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a ban on the Chinese application, there is no assurance that we will not be exposed to liability and we may be exposed to significant fines, litigation, indemnification claims, negative publicity, reputational harm, diversion of management attention, interruptions in our operations, financial loss and other similar harms by continuing to provide services to the Chinese application.\nSome of these risks are fairly straightforward. The fines attached to the law are catastrophically severe, and the reason they’re not being levied is, basically, because Donald Trump and Pam Bondi say so. Business leaders frequently complain about regulatory uncertainty, arguing that it makes planning for the future and allocating resources more difficult. The TikTok situation both resembles and exceeds the sorts of things they’re usually referring to. It’s not just TikTok’s legal status that’s up in the air — it’s the entire relationship between different parts of the government and companies that operate on its watch and under its jurisdiction. Akamai’s “other similar harms,” in other words, involve questions like: Can the president unilaterally decide which laws are enforced? Can the president unilaterally write new laws? What is law, really, anyway?\nThis is a strange and miniaturizing lens for what appears to be a much broader potential constitutional crisis and isn’t likely to be the matter that ultimately triggers it (all eyes are on DOGE for that). Most people don’t know or care about Akamai, the TikTok ban was never especially popular, and the prospect of just sort of ignoring a strange and unprecedented law banning a popular app isn’t the sort of thing that’s likely to get too many people riled up. But as a matter of process, the situation is both surreal and potentially instructive. Among the risks implied but not elucidated in the filing is the possibility that as quickly and arbitrarily as the executive branch can choose not to enforce a law, it can choose to enforce it again. It’s easy enough to imagine what a motivated government led by a man who negotiates with threats might do with such leverage over a basic internet infrastructure firm like Akamai — without it, for example, TikTok couldn’t go back online. But it’s even easier to imagine what use such leverage might be when applied to Apple and Google, two of the largest and most influential tech companies on earth.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission."

INTERFAX.RU - Арбитражный суд Москвы 27 февраля по ходатайству Федеральной налоговой службы (ФНС) арестовал имущество бывшего гендиректора ООО \"Гугл\" - российской \"дочки\" Google (входит в Alphabet Inc.) Юлии Соловьевой.\nКак отмечается в определении суда, размещенном на сайте, меры приняты в рамках заявления конкурсного управляющего ООО \"Гугл\" Валерия Таляровского о привлечении солидарно к субсидиарной ответственности Google International LLC, Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited, а также бывших топ-менеджеров компании Снэддона Дэвида Мунро, Дасаро Биондо Карло Сальваторе Мариа, Соловьевой и Юлии Рамазановой.\nВ документе говорится, что суд запретил Росреестру осуществлять регистрационные действия в отношении недвижимости Соловьевой стоимостью 232,8 млн рублей, запретил ей осуществлять сделки с принадлежащими ей транспортными средствами на сумму 13,5 млн рублей. Кроме того, суд арестовал ее денежные средства, за исключением прожиточного минимума самого гражданина и лиц, находящихся на его иждивении.\nООО \"Гугл\" обратилось в суд с заявлением о собственном банкротстве в июне 2022 года.\nАрбитражный суд Москвы 12 сентября 2022 года признал это заявление обоснованным и ввел в отношении компании процедуру наблюдения.\nДебиторская задолженность компании составляла тогда 27 млрд 25 млн рублей против 18,7 млрд рублей общих денежных обязательств у должника перед кредиторами, уточнялось в судебном акте.\nВ определении тогда отмечалось, что у должника на счете в Ситибанке на тот момент находились 636 тыс. рублей, основные средства оценивались в 28,5 млн рублей, нематериальные активы - в 14 млн рублей, товарно-материальные ценности - в 15,2 млн рублей, а также иные активы на общую сумму 3,8 млрд рублей.\nПри этом задолженность по оплате труда работников должника и выплате им выходных пособий составляла 271,2 млн рублей, по обязательным платежам - 85,7 млн рублей.\nСуд на первом заседании по делу о банкротстве привлек Росфинмониторинг третьим лицом в разбирательстве.\nПредставитель должника тогда пояснил подачу заявления о банкротстве тем, что на тот момент размер требований кредиторов компании превышал 19 млрд рублей, тогда как активы составляли лишь около 3,5 млрд рублей.\nСреди кредиторов - коммерческие организации, налоговый орган и сотрудники компании.\nУчастники первого собрания кредиторов компании, на которых приходится 97,2% от общей суммы требований к ООО \"Гугл\", в августе 2023 года решили обратиться в Арбитражный суд Москвы с ходатайством о признании компании банкротом и об открытии конкурсного производства.\nОбъем денежных обязательств ООО \"Гугл\" перед кредиторами и уполномоченными органами составляет почти 20,2 млрд рублей, говорилось в материалах собрания кредиторов, состоявшегося 22 августа 2023 года. Участником собрания кредиторов с самым большим размером требований стала ФНС РФ в лице МИ ФНС по крупнейшим налогоплательщикам №7, она предъявила требования на 19,57 млрд рублей.\n18 октября 2023 года суд признал ООО \"Гугл\" банкротом, ввел в отношении должника конкурсное производство и утвердил конкурсным управляющим Таляровского, который ранее был временным управляющим.\nНа заседании в октябре 2023 года представитель временного управляющего заявил, что в реестр кредиторов на тот момент были включены требования 861 кредитора, сумма требований - около 53,6 млрд рублей.\nООО \"Гугл\" зарегистрировано в 2005 году. По итогам 2021 года выручка российской компании составила 134,3 млрд рублей, при этом она получила чистый убыток в 26 млрд рублей (это первый убыток как минимум с 2009 года).\nРоссийские регуляторы с помощью мер административного и судебного реагирования добиваются от Google удаления запрещенного контента из сервисов корпорации, локализации персональных данных пользователей из РФ, снятия ограничений с YouTube-каналов российских СМИ.\nВ частности, за неоднократные нарушения российского законодательства Google с конца 2021 года дважды подверглась в РФ оборотным штрафам на общую сумму более 29 млрд рублей. Часть денежных средств была взыскана с компании Федеральной службой судебных приставов."

            "full_content": "America's leading patent law source\nThe Federal Circuit recently heard oral arguments in the much-anticipated en banc review of EcoFactor, Inc. v. Google LLC, a case focusing on how courts evaluate expert testimony on patent damages.  And, in particular, when a court should step-in to bar expert testimony that does not have sufficient factual basis for its conclusions.  The arguments focused on whether EcoFactor's damages expert improperly derived royalty rates from license agreements that contained performative non-binding \"whereas\" clauses stating EcoFactor's belief about rates, while the operative provisions specified lump-sum payments.  It seems clear to me that these provisions were added as elements of the patentee's smaller license agreements in order to later be used in larger cases, such as the one against Google.\nJudge Alan Albright (W.D.Tex.) admitted testimony from EcoFactor's damages expert, David Kennedy, who derived a per-unit royalty rate from three prior EcoFactor settlement agreements to calculate a $20 million damages award against Google for infringing EcoFactor's smart thermostat patent, U.S. Patent 8,738,327.\nTo continue reading, become a Patently-O member.

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/APP.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, The Complaint adds that Defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. \nOn February 26, 2025, before the market opened, Fuzzy Panda Research issued a report called “AppLovin (APP) – Formers Allege Ad Fraud; Is DTC Hype Actually Stealing Meta’s Data; Illegal Tracking of Children & Serving Sex Ads to Kids.” Covering this report, Investing.com released a report entitled “AppLovin stock falls on allegations of ad fraud.” This article stated that AppLovin shares had fallen following the report, “which accuses the mobile ad-tech company of engaging in “Ad Fraud” and other dubious practices. The report alleges that AppLovin’s success, particularly with its machine-learning algorithm Axon 2.0, may be the result of unethical and potentially illegal activities, including data theft from Meta Platforms Inc [. . .] and violations of app store policies set by [Apple and Google].” Further, this article stated that according to Fuzzy Panda Research, “AppLovin’s expansion into e-commerce is marred by tactics that include “reverse engineering” Meta’s data and exploiting consumer data in ways that breach the terms of service of major app stores. The report suggests that AppLovin’s high click-through rates (CTRs) and revenue growth could be attributed to these deceptive strategies, rather than legitimate business practices.” On this news, AppLovin stock fell sharply in intraday trading on February 26, 2025.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to review a copy of the Complaint, you can visit the firm’s site: bgandg.com/APP or you may contact Peretz Bronstein, Esq. or his Client Relations Manager, Nathan Miller, of Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC at  332-239-2660.

ФССП России по истечении 60 дней после назначенного столичным судом в отношении Google административного штрафа на сумму более 8 млрд рублей за уклонение от уплаты ранее вынесенных штрафов взыскала часть денежных средств со счета компании-нарушителя. Об этом говорится в материалах административного дела, которые есть в распоряжении ТАСС.\n\"Гугл ЛЛС (Google LLC) штраф не был оплачен, в связи с чем после истечения 60 дней был составлен протокол об административном правонарушении (ст. 20.25 КоАП РФ). Извещение Гугл ЛЛС (Google LLC) было направлено через личный кабинет Роскомнадзора, - следует из судебных документов. - Штраф был частично списан с ООО \"Гугл\".\nНа основании двух решений арбитражных судов по делу о банкротстве Гугл ЛЛС (Google LLC) ее представителем признали ООО \"Гугл\", напомнила юристу компании апелляционная инстанция. Вслед за этими судебными решениями после введения процедуры наблюдения была признана банкротом и российская дочка компании.\n14 января мировой судья в Москве оштрафовал компанию на 8 млрд 8 млн 684 тыс. 193 рублей за уклонение от уплаты ранее назначенных штрафов. Позднее Чертановский суд Москвы признал законным назначенный первой инстанцией штраф.\nПо состоянию на конец февраля в отношении американской компании Google LLC были открыты исполнительные производства о взыскании задолженности на общую сумму более 21,5 млрд рублей по штрафам и иным взысканиям судов имущественного характера в пользу физических и юридических лиц.\nКроме того, в октябре прошлого года Google был оштрафован в размере 2 ундециллионов рублей из-за блокировки аккаунтов российских телеканалов на YouTube. В январе сумма требований российских ТВ-каналов достигла 1,81 дуодециллиона рублей (единица с 39 нулями).\nВместе с тем американская Google International LLC уже попросила Верховный суд РФ пересмотреть судебные акты трех нижестоящих инстанций, признавших незаконным перечисление в ее адрес дочерним ООО \"Гугл\" в 2021 году порядка 9,5 млрд рублей в качестве дивидендов и выплату 500 млн рублей налогов на эту сумму. Соответствующая кассационная жалоба компании поступила в ВС РФ на прошлой неделе, следует из картотеки арбитражных дел. После распределения в ближайшее время материалов судье решение по жалобе Google будет принято уже до конца весны этого года."

При неисполнении решения суда в течение девяти месяцев сумма первоначального штрафа удваивается каждый день, и предела этому увеличению нет.

            "full_content": "МОСКВА, 20 марта. /ТАСС/. Компания Google в конце 2024 года не смогла подготовиться к процессу в московском суде, по итогам которого ей был назначен административный штраф в размере более 8 млрд рублей за уклонение от уплаты ранее вынесенных штрафов, из-за католического Рождества. Об этом говорится в материалах административного дела, с текстом которого ознакомился корреспондент ТАСС.\n\"Извещения были направлены в канун католического Рождества, и Гугл ЛЛС (Google LLC) 25 декабря 2024 года и 26 декабря 2024 года не работали\", - следует из текста апелляционной жалобы, которую в суде поддержал представитель компании и попросил производство по делу прекратить.\nТак, юрист российской дочки заявил, что суд первой инстанции лишил Google права на защиту и квалифицированную помощь. Вместе с тем протокол об административном правонарушении в отношении компании был составлен 27 декабря 2024 года, а католическое Рождество отмечается 25 декабря, его канун - 24 декабря. Ни в РФ, ни в США указанные защитником даты привлеченной к ответственности Google выходными днями не являлись, следует из ответа российского суда в апелляции.\nКроме того, по мнению представителя оштрафованной компании, мировой судья якобы не применил срока давности и не создал ей равные с другими процессуальными сторонами условия при рассмотрении административного протокола. В ходе заседания юрист Google заявляла ходатайство об отложении процесса, но ей в этом было отказано.\nТакже в докумантах утверждается, что американская Google International LLC не давала полномочий на представление ее интересов в российском суде юристу ООО \"Гугл\". Как следует из материалов, представленные в деле скриншоты якобы не подтверждают, что американская компания была надлежащим образом извещена о дате судебного заседания, а пристав не присутствовал при извещении Google Роскомнадзором.\nВ опровержение данных утверждений апелляционная инстанция напомнила, что для ознакомления с материалами дела и подготовки позиции представителю административного ответчика 14 января (когда был назначен штраф) предлагалось объявить перерыв на 2 часа. Однако позиция Google по вменяемому ей правонарушению не была представлена также и в жалобе. Довод компании о том, что в суде не было оглашено соответствующее постановление, является несостоятельным, так как ее представитель не участвовала в судебном заседании и \"ушла по собственной инициативе\". \"Это является недобросовестным поведением, - следует из судебных документов. - Штраф в установленный срок не оплачен\"."

            "full_content": "UPDATED 18:11 EDT / MARCH 12 2025\n\n\n\n\t                    \t\t                        by \nMaria Deutscher\n\n\nGoogle LLC today introduced two new artificial intelligence models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, that are optimized to power autonomous machines.\nThe algorithms are based on the company’s Gemini 2.0 series of large language models. Introduced in December, the LLMs can process not only text but also multimodal data as video. This latter capability enables the new Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER models to analyze footage from a robot’s cameras when making decisions.\nGemini Robotics is described as a vision-language-action model. According to Google, robots equipped with the model can perform complex tasks based on natural language instructions. A user could, for example, ask the AI to fold paper into origami shapes or place items in a Ziploc bag.\nHistorically, teaching an industrial robot a new task required manual programming. The task necessities specialized skills and can consume a significant amount of time. To ease the robot configuration process, Google’s researchers built Gemini Robotics with generality in mind. The company says that the AI can carry out tasks it was not taught to perform during training, which reduces the need for manual programming. \nTo test how well Gemini Robotics responds to new tasks, Google evaluated it using an AI generalization benchmark. The company determined the algorithm more than doubled the performance of earlier vision-language-action models. According to Google, Gemini Robotics can not only perform tasks it was not taught to perform but also change how it carries out those tasks when environmental conditions change.\n“If an object slips from its grasp, or someone moves an item around, Gemini Robotics quickly replans and carries on — a crucial ability for robots in the real world, where surprises are the norm,” Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, detailed in a blog post.\nThe other new AI model that the company debuted today, Robotics-ER, is geared toward spatial reasoning. This is a term for the complex sequence of computations that a robot must carry out before it can perform a task. Picking up a coffee mug, for example, requires a robotic arm to find the handle and calculate the angle from which it should be approached.\nAfter developing a plan for how to carry out a task, Gemini Robotics-ER uses Gemini 2.0’s coding capabilities to turn the plan into a configuration script. This script programs the robot in which the AI is installed. If a task proves too complicated for Gemini Robotics-EP, developers can teach it the best course of action with a “handful of human demonstrations.” \n“Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation,” Parada wrote. “In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0.”\nGoogle will make Gemini Robotics-ER available to several partners, including Apptronik Inc., a humanoid robot startup that raised $350 million last month. The funding round saw the search giant join as an investor. Google will collaborate with Apptronik to develop humanoid robots equipped with Gemini 2.0.\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

            "full_content": "UPDATED 17:13 EDT / FEBRUARY 25 2025\n\n\n\n\t                    \t\t                        by \nMaria Deutscher\n\n\nGoogle LLC today made Gemini Code Assist, its artificial intelligence programming assistant, available at no charge for individual developers.\nThe new free tier supports up to 6,000 requests per day or 180,000 per month. That’s 90 times higher than the usage cap GitHub applies to the free tier of GitHub Copilot, its competing AI coding assistant. The increased competition from Google might prompt the Microsoft Corp. unit to boost its usage cap or provide features currently only available in paid plans. \nGemini Code Assist launched last year at the search giant’s Cloud Next conference. It works with popular code editors from Microsoft and JetBrains SRO. In those editors’ interface, the service takes the form of a chatbot sidebar next to the main window.\nDevelopers can ask Gemini Code Assist to explain a piece of code written by a colleague. The chatbot is also capable of generating new code from scratch. According to Google, the user only has to describe what the new code snippet should do and the programming language in which it should be written. Gemini Code Assist supports all programming languages in the public domain.\nThe service’s new free tier supports prompts with up to 128,000 tokens. One token corresponds to a few letters or numbers. The large context window allows developers to combine a code generation request with contextual information, such as programming examples, that can help Gemini Code Assist generate higher-quality output.\nThe service processes prompts with Gemini 2.0, the latest iteration of Google’s flagship large language model series. In December, the company revealed a midrange model from the series called Gemini 2.0 Flash. It provides higher output quality than the top-end edition of Google’s previous flagship LLM with twice the response speed.\nThe version of Gemini 2.0 that powers Gemini Code Assistant is optimized for programming tasks. “We fine-tuned the Gemini 2.0 model for developers by analyzing and validating a large number of real-world coding use cases,” Ryan Salva, a senior director of product management at Google, detailed in a blog post. “As a result, the quality of AI-generated recommendations in Gemini Code Assist is better than ever before.”\nAlongside the launch of the new free tier, Google today debuted a feature called Gemini Code Assist for GitHub in preview. It’s designed to automate parts of the code review workflow. \nWhen developers update an application, they package the changes into a proposal called a pull request. The new code only rolls out to production after the pull request is approved by colleagues. Many enterprises rely on GitHub’s software hosting platform to power this workflow.\nAccording to Google, Gemini Code Assist for GitHub automatically summarizes pull requests to help developers review their contents. The AI also checks the new code for bugs. It can detect other issues as well, such as cases where a code snippet should be rewritten because it’s difficult to understand or doesn’t adhere to company best practices. \nGoogle will continue offering the original paid editions of Gemini Code Assistant alongside the new free tier. Those plans include integrations that allow the AI to perform tasks in Google Cloud services, such as writing queries for the BigQuery data warehouse. The paid versions can also improve the quality of AI-generated programming suggestions by taking into account a company’s existing code.\nStrike raises $13.5M to expand its AI-driven continuous penetration testing platform\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nStrike raises $13.5M to expand its AI-driven continuous penetration testing platform\nSECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 3 HOURS AGO\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 6 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 9 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 11 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 12 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

The same day, OpenAI submitted a similar policy document to the White House.\nThe two companies drafted the recommendations in response to an AI-focused executive order that President Donald Trump signed earlier this year. The order calls for the creation of a policy framework, dubbed the AI Action Plan, that will determine how the administration approaches the AI market. In February, the White House asked tech firms and other interested parties to submit ideas for the policy framework.\nGoogle’s 12-page paper contains more than a half-dozen recommendations. Several of the suggestions focus on AI-related legislative matters, most notably the way copyright law applies to training data.\nGoogle’s paper backs copyright exceptions that “allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training.” The search giant argues that such exceptions are important for, among other things, AI tools that speed up scientific research. In particular, Google points to machine learning applications that allow researchers to sift quickly through a large number of academic papers.\nAnother legislative idea the company floated relates to state-level AI laws. Google is suggesting the White House “support federal legislation that prevents a patchwork of laws at the state level, especially for frontier AI development.” The company argues that a fragmented regulatory landscape could slow AI development.\nYet another set of policy recommendations in Google’s paper focuses on the federal government’s day-to-day operations. Agencies “should lead by example in AI adoption” by using machine learning products from multiple suppliers, Google argues. According to the company, the U.S. Commerce Department bureau tasked with enforcing export controls could use AI for supply chain tracking. Google’s paper goes on to argue that the bureau should “avoid creating undue competitive disadvantages” for U.S. AI providers.\nIn the utility sector, Google believes policy changes are needed to meet the electricity demands of AI data centers. The company argues that the permitting process for new energy infrastructure should be streamlined. Additionally, it sees a need for incentives that would encourage utilities to use their existing infrastructure more efficiently.\nAnother section of Google’s paper focuses on AI research. According to the company, the U.S. government should direct more funding to “early-market R&D” and support federal prize challenges that encourage AI breakthroughs. Google also sees a need to make technical resources such as compute infrastructure more accessible for researchers.\nThere are some similarities between the search giant’s suggestions and the policy paper that OpenAI submitted for the White House’s AI Action Plan. Like Google, the ChatGPT rival is reportedly “seeking some relief” from state-level AI rules. OpenAI is also asking officials to relax the copyright rules that apply to data used in AI training projects. \nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 10 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

The report also claims that processing could be done differently, with MediaTek handling input/out modules that manage the communication between the main processors and peripheral components.\nGoogle currently uses Broadcom Inc. to produce its TPU chips and while MediaTek may start producing the next generation of chips, it’s noted that Google hasn’t cut ties with Broadcom, at least for the time being.\nGoogle’s TPUs are custom-designed application-specific integrated circuits developed to accelerate machine learning tasks, particularly those involving neural networks. The chips are optimized for Google’s TensorFlow framework and enhance both training and inference processes by efficiently handling the computational demands of deep learning models.\nTPUs differ from traditional processors by being tailored for high-volume, low-precision arithmetic operations. The specialization enables TPUs to deliver significant performance improvements and energy efficiency compared with general-purpose central processing units and graphics processing units.\nIn cloud environments, TPUs are integrated into Google’s data centers to provide scalable and efficient resources for large-scale machine-learning tasks. For edge computing, Google offers the Edge TPU, a compact and power-efficient version designed to bring AI capabilities to devices such as smartphones and IoT applications.\nWhile TPUs have various purposes, AI is among their best-known applications. The specialized processors are designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, particularly those involving neural networks, by efficiently handling the massive computations required for training and inference.\nAs noted by Reuters, being able to produce in-house AI chips also gives Google a competitive edge in the AI race by reducing its reliance on Nvidia,” with Nvidia Corp. currently dominating the market for AI chips.\nThe most recent release of Google TPUs was the sixth generation, the Trillium TPU, which was announced in October. Offered an alternative to Nvidia’s popular GPUs, Trillium provides a four-times performance boost in terms of AI training and a three-times boost in inference throughput compared with the previous generation of chips.\nTrillium TPUs also include increased memory and bandwidth allowing the chips to run much larger large language models with more weights and larger key-value caches. The chip supports a broader range of model architectures in both training and inference.\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 7 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

This style of editing can be tedious and slow, making iterating through a document plodding when asking, “Please change the sentence of the second paragraph.” Instead with Canvas, a user can adjust the sentence directly.\nSentences and paragraphs can also be highlighted, allowing users to trigger Gemini with a prompt to modify them. According to Google, this will permit users to collaborate deeply with more nuanced editing decisions with text – including both research and fine-tuning their documents.\nOnce a user is done editing a document in Canvas they can easily export it into Google Docs where they can continue collaborating on their text with their coworkers.\nFor code, developers can ask Gemini to write code that will also appear in the sidebar, where they can edit alongside Gemini. For web apps, it can visualize changes in HTML, CSS and React JavaScript, allowing software engineers to collaborate with the chatbot.\nA solar system simulation JavaScript web app made using Gemini with only three prompts.\nAs the chatbot changes the web app, the user can interact with the app in the canvas including click buttons, watch animations and play around with the user interface. For example, it could be used to make a simple simulation of the solar system and include statistics for each of the planets.\nWeb apps generated by the Gemini app can run from relatively simple to extremely complex, depending on the amount of time and fine-tuning the developer wants to spend talking to the AI. Advanced developers and beginners with little or no experience can create complicated web applications in only a few minutes of conversation with the chatbot.\nDuring a presentation led by Google, Citron said that this is just another step in the company’s work toward making the Gemini app more “agentic.”\n“In general, this Canvas ability is yet another part of making the Gemini app increasingly agentic,” Citron explained. “And by agentic, I mean this idea that AI is working on your behalf to get things done and not just simple things like turning on the lights, but more and more incredible things that I didn’t even think was possible with AI until a couple of years ago.”\nCanvas is available today to all users of Gemini globally.\nAudio Overview transforms documents, text and extensive notes or reports from Gemini’s Deep Research tool into an engaging, podcast-like audio discussion featuring two AI-voiced speakers.\nIn this format, the speakers engage in a witty back-and-forth, reminiscent of a talk show, as they summarize the topic, connect key points and share light-hearted banter.\nThis capability was introduced by Google in 2024 as part of NotebookLM, the company’s AI-powered note-taking and research assistant. It functions similarly to the research assistant, enabling users to listen to the audio while their hands and eyes are occupied with other tasks, such as driving or doing chores, allowing them to stay informed with AI-generated information.\nGoogle announced that the Audio Overview feature is now available globally to Gemini and Gemini Advanced subscribers, initially in English, with plans to roll out additional languages in the coming weeks.\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 10 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

These ranges permit AI engineers and developers to pick the best model for the hardware and performance needs. For example, if it will be running on a GPU or tensor processing unit – allowing for a larger more complex model – or a smartphone – requiring a tiny model.\nThe technology underlying Gemma shares the same technical research as Google’s Gemini model, which is the most complex and powerful model the company has produced to date. Gemini powers the Gemini AI chatbot, formerly named Bard, which is available on the web and mobile devices and is also used to deliver many of Google’s AI-based services.\nWith this technical design, Google said Gemma 3 is capable of delivering high performance for its size, outperforming larger models such as Llama-405B, DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI’s o3-mini in preliminary human preference evaluations on the LMArena leaderboard.\nEven when run on a single device or GPU, Gemma still provides enough power for developers to create AI applications with multimodal capabilities with advanced text and visual reasoning. It has a 128,000-token context window, which means it can handle around 30 high-resolution images, a 300-page book or an hour or more of video. This is comparable to the context length of OpenAI’s GPT-4o.\nGoogle said the model family includes function-calling and tool-use capabilities that will enable developers to automate tasks and build AI agents. In combination with the large context window, Gemma 3 will be able to ingest large amounts of data and automate complex sequential tasks.\nAlongside Gemma 3, Google also announced ShieldGemma 2, a 4 billion-parameter variant that can check images for safety and label them as safe or dangerous.\nSheildGemma enables developers to build applications that can examine uploaded images for potentially hazardous content. It outputs safety labels across three different categories such as “dangerous content,” “sexually explicit” and “violence.”\nDevelopers using it in their applications can further tailor the model for their needs by providing content to watch for and label. Its weights and parameters are also open source so it can be trained for different industry needs and controls.\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

Officials have ordered Apple to change a number of iOS features that were found to run afoul of the DMA. The EU’s antitrust findings about Google, in turn, are preliminary, which means the search giant has not yet been instructed to change any business practices.\nThe DMA, or Digital Markets Act, is an antitrust law that passed in 2022. It’s designed to regulate large tech firms that receive “gatekeeper” status from the European Commission. Apple and Google received that designation about a year after the DMA went into effect.\nOne of the requirements set forth in the law is that gatekeepers make their platforms interoperable with third-party products. This clause is the focus of the antitrust decision that the EU brought against Apple today. Under the decision, the company must make iPhones more interoperable with third-party connected devices and apps.\nThe antitrust order covers nine “connectivity features” in iOS. The list includes capabilities that consumers can use to display iPhone notifications on a smartwatch and establish peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections between mobile devices. The iPhone’s near field communication chip, which allows users to make in-store payments, is also a focus of the antitrust decision.\nApple will be required to make the features on the list more accessible to device manufactures and app developers. Additionally, the iPhone maker has been ordered to streamline the process through which companies apply for access to those features. It must now review interoperability requests under a “more predictable timeline,” as well as provide prompt updates to applicants during the review.\nThe company pushed back against the EU’s regulatory action in a statement. “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules,” it said in a statement. “It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”\nIn a separate decision, the EU today tentatively found that Google has breached the DMA. Officials focused on two parts of the company’s business: its search engine and the Google Play app store.\nUnder the DMA, a tech giant with gatekeeper status can’t give its own products an edge in its search service. The EU believes Google failed to comply with that requirement. According to antitrust officials, several of the company’s services including its shopping and hotel booking tools appear above competing offerings in Google Search results.\nEU regulators also took issue with the company’s practices in the mobile market.\nAccording to the European Commission, the fees that Google applies to app sales in Google Play are excessive. Regulators believe that the restrictions the company places on steering breach the DMA as well. Steering is the practice whereby developers ask customers to purchase in-app items such as subscriptions outside Google Play.\n“Today’s announcement by the European Commission pushes for more changes to Google Search, Android and Play that will hurt European businesses and consumers, hinder innovation, weaken security, and degrade product quality,” Oliver Bethell, Google’s director of competition, wrote in a blog post responding to the EU’s preliminary findings. \nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 7 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

Так было с Януковичем, который начал отжимать активы старых друзей, так было и с Порошенко, который вступил в жесткий конфликт с Коломойским и рядом других крупных бизнесменов. Так, вероятно, будет и с Зеленским.\nЭксперт назвал закономерным арест имущества экс-главы российской «дочки» Google\n«История с банкротством российской \"дочки\" Google и арестом имущества Юлии Соловьевой – закономерное последствие многолетней деятельности ИТ-гиганта, основанной на глобальных финансовых махинациях, уклонении от налогов и вопиющей цензуре. Соловьева, будучи публичным лицом компании, долгое время с пеной у рта уверяла всех, что Google ведет бизнес прозрачно и в рамках закона. Но теперь ей придется лично отвечать за все темные делишки ИТ-гиганта. Аресты недвижимости на сотни миллионов и дорогих автомобилей говорят сами за себя: нажито, что называется, \"непосильным трудом\". Когда ты работаешь на компанию, чьи методы – это фальсификация отчетности, офшоры и монополизация, расплата неизбежна», – сказал он.\nАрбитражный суд Москвы удовлетворил ходатайство Федеральной налоговой службы о введении обеспечительных мер в отношении имущества Юлии Соловьевой. Судебное решение запрещает любые регистрационные действия с недвижимостью Соловьевой.\n Стоимость имущества превышает 232 млн рублей. Под арест попали жилые и нежилые помещения в Москве, Московской области и Красногорске.\nКроме того, арест наложен на два автомобиля BMW: X7 2021 года выпуска и Z4 2011 года выпуска, общая стоимость которых превышает 13 млн рублей. Также арестованы денежные средства на банковских счетах Соловьевой, за исключением суммы, равной прожиточному минимуму.\nЭти меры были приняты в рамках дела о банкротстве ООО «Гугл», признанного несостоятельным в октябре 2023 года. Конкурсный управляющий Валерий Таляровский также инициировал привлечение к субсидиарной ответственности компаний Google International LLC, Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited и других связанных лиц.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\nВ результате действий группировки «Запад» освобожден населенный пункт Мирное в ДНР, указало ведомство в своем Telegram-канале. Группировка «Днепр» освободила населенный пункт Малые Щербаки в Запорожской области.\nПоражены формирования ВСУ в районах Харьковской области и ДНР, украинская сторона потеряла более 250 человек и технику. \nНа Белгородском направлении группировка «Север» поразила живую силу и технику ВСУ у Угроедов, Мирополья и Краснополья, украинская армия потеряла до 50 военнослужащих и несколько единиц техники. \nВ зоне ответственности подразделений «Южной» группировки ВСУ потеряли до 200 человек и значительное количество техники. \nВ зоне действия группировки «Центр» украинская армия потеряла до 430 военнослужащих.

Об этом пишет ТАСС. \n«Давайте внесем ясность относительно Будапештского меморандума: ядерное оружие принадлежало России, и это были остатки», – заявил Гренелл.\nОн добавил, что Украина вернула это ядерное оружие России, подчеркнув, что оно не было украинским: «Это неудобный факт», – подытожил он. \nБудапештский меморандум был подписан Россией, Украиной, США и Британией 5 декабря 1994 года и предоставлял Киеву гарантии безопасности в обмен на отказ от ядерного арсенала и присоединение к Договору о нераспространении ядерного оружия (ДНЯО).\nТогдашний ядерный арсенал, оставшийся после распада СССР на Украине, включал значительное количество зарядов и средств доставки, что делало ее третьей по ядерному потенциалу после США и России.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, глава киевского режима Владимир Зеленский требовал от США обещания ядерного удара по России в случае необходимости для обеспечения мира на Украине.\nВоенкор Первого канала Анна Прокофьева погибла на вражеской мине в Белгородской области\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nВоенный корреспондент Первого канала Анна Прокофьева погибла в Белгородской области при выполнении журналистских обязанностей, передает ТАСС. Инцидент произошел на границе с Украиной, когда съемочная группа наткнулась на вражескую мину. В результате взрыва Анна Прокофьева погибла, а оператор Дмитрий Волков получил ранения.\nПрокофьевой было 35 лет. Она окончила Российский университет дружбы народов по специальности «журналистика» и свободно владела испанским языком. С сентября 2020 года по ноябрь 2022-го Прокофьева работала в испанской редакции агентства Sputnik. В этот период она вела Telegram-блог для сбора гуманитарной помощи и после ухода из Sputnik продолжила доставлять ее в зону СВО.\nВ 2023 году она начала свою работу на Первом канале как военный корреспондент, освещая события из зоны специальной военной операции. Анна вела Telegram-канал Журналистка | Z |, вот ее последняя публикация:\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, оператор телеканала «Звезда» Андрей Панов, водитель Александр Сиркели и военный корреспондент «Известий» Александр Федорчак погибли в зоне СВО в результате ракетного удара ВСУ по гражданской машине.\n В редакции «Известий» появился мемориал в память о погибшем военкоре Федорчаке. \nОфициальный представитель МИД России Мария Захарова осудила Киев за убийство российских журналистов в ЛНР.\nКремль опубликовал список подпадающих под мораторий на удары по энергосистеме объектов\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nПо информации из Telegram-канала Кремля, в список вошли нефтеперерабатывающие предприятия, нефте- и газопроводы, хранилища и насосные станции.\n Также под действие моратория попадают вырабатывающая и передающая электричество инфраструктура, включая электростанции, подстанции, трансформаторы и распределители. Кроме того, временным соглашением защищены атомные электростанции и дамбы гидроэлектростанций.\n Мораторий вступает в силу задним числом – с 18 марта 2025 года и будет действовать 30 суток. Стороны оставляют за собой возможность продлить соглашение по взаимной договоренности. В случае нарушения одной из сторон обязательств, другая сторона вправе считать себя свободной от их соблюдения.\nРанее в Кремле сообщили, что Россия и США на встрече в Эр-Рияде договорились о реализации «Черноморской инициативы», включающей меры по безопасности судоходства и запрет ударов по энергетическим объектам на 30 дней. \nБелый дом опубликовал заявление по итогам встречи экспертных групп России и США в Эр-Рияде 23–25 марта.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nКак передает ТАСС, лесной массив у Гуева в Курской области заминирован украинскими военнослужащими, что создает препятствия как для продвижения российских сил, так и для отступления самих ВСУ. В результате этого ВСУ оказались заперты в лесу, не имея возможности отойти в сторону Сумской области, откуда они изначально пришли. \nРоссийские силовые структуры заявляют, что продолжают уничтожать врага в лесных массивах, где еще остаются группы украинских военных.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, украинские военные начали хаотично минировать поля в Запорожской области, опасаясь прорыва российских войск, дистанционно заминировали гражданские объекты в Курской области, а также устанавливали мины в квартирах при отступлении из Новогродовки.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\n«Министерство обороны над этим думает, и, конечно, этот вопрос стоит остро. Безусловно, его не забываем. Но исходить будем из реалий, которые складываются на линии боевого соприкосновения», – сказал президент, передает ТАСС. Так он ответил на соответствующий вопрос писателя Захара Прилепина.\nПрезидент подчеркнул, что многие из мобилизованных стали реально профессиональными военными: «Они – полноценные боевые единицы, они работают как профессионалы рядом со своими боевыми товарищами из профессиональных воинских коллективов».\nТакже в ходе заседания Совета глава государства назвал воспитание молодежи, пробуждение в ней любви к стране одной из важнейших задач общества и государства.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nНа встрече экспертных групп России и США были достигнуты несколько ключевых договоренностей, сообщает Кремль в Telegram-канале. В рамках «Черноморской инициативы» стороны согласовали меры по обеспечению безопасности судоходства в Черном море, неприменению силы и запрету использования коммерческих судов в военных целях. Контроль за соблюдением этих обязательств будет осуществляться посредством досмотра судов.\nСША обязались способствовать восстановлению доступа российского экспорта сельскохозяйственной продукции и удобрений на мировой рынок. Это включает в себя снижение стоимости страхования морских перевозок и расширение доступа к международным портам и платежным системам.\nОднако реализация этих мер начнется только после выполнения ряда условий. В их числе – отмена санкций в отношении «Россельхозбанка» и других финансовых структур, обеспечивающих торговлю продовольствием и удобрениями, восстановление их подключения к SWIFT и открытие необходимых корреспондентских счетов.\nТакже необходимо снятие ограничений на торговое финансирование и на деятельность российских производителей и экспортеров продовольствия, включая рыбопродукцию. Помимо этого, требуется разблокировать возможность страхования грузов, обслуживать в портах российские суда, задействованные в торговле продовольствием и удобрениями, а также снять запреты на поставку в Россию сельскохозяйственной техники и других товаров, критически важных для агропромышленного сектора.\nРоссия и США согласились разработать меры по запрету ударов по объектам энергетики сроком на тридцать суток, начиная с 18 марта 2025 года, с возможностью продления. Стороны также выразили готовность принимать помощь третьих стран в поддержке данных договоренностей.\n Обе стороны заявили о намерении продолжать работу по достижению прочного и продолжительного мира, укрепляя двусторонние соглашения в энергетической и морской сферах.\nНапомним, переговоры делегаций России и США в Эр-Рияде длились более 12 часов.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nЛукьянов в своем Telegram-канале отметил, что, судя по комментариям главы МИД России Сергея Лаврова относительно переговоров, процесс вернулся в русло 2022-2023 годов. В то время шли сложные дискуссии по различным вопросам, включая Минско-Стамбульские соглашения и зерновую сделку.\n Лукьянов подчеркнул, что переговоры в этом жанре обычно показывают сдвиги только в контексте серьезных военных событий. Без таких событий переговорный процесс зачастую становится самоценным и не приводит к заключению соглашений. Это связано с политической культурой украинской стороны, которая проявляется с начала независимости, отметил политолог.\n Однако теперь, по словам Лукьянова, в переговорах появился фактор, которого не было с момента обсуждений вывоза ядерного оружия с Украины 30 лет назад – заинтересованное в результате американское руководство. Несмотря на опыт и умение добиваться успеха, американцам придется учесть, что украинская ситуация отличается от других мировых конфликтов, таких как в Колумбии или Гренландии, заявил он.\n«Сейчас, правда, есть фактор, которого давно не было (с переговоров о вывозе с Украины ядерного оружия 30 лет назад), – американское руководство, заинтересованное в результате. И вроде бы умеющее добиваться его, переламывая обстоятельства. Но украинский сюжет – не Колумбия и даже не Гренландия. Так что трампистам тоже предстоит узнать нечто новое для себя», – написал Лукьянов.\nНапомним, переговоры делегаций России и США в Эр-Рияде длились более 12 часов. Пресс-секретарь президента России Дмитрий Песков сообщил, что содержание переговоров не планируется обнародовать.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nПо его словам, российская экономика второй год подряд демонстрирует темпы роста, которые вдвое превышают среднемировые показатели, сообщает ТАСС. Мишустин отметил, что рост отечественной экономики в шесть раз опережает европейский. \n«А в ряде этих государств уже наблюдается рецессия. Например, экономика Германии все это время сокращается», – добавил он. \nПремьер-министр подчеркнул, что ВВП России по итогам 2024 года достиг 200 трлн рублей, увеличившись почти вдвое с 2020 года. Он отметил, что локомотивом такого роста стал внутренний спрос, как инвестиционный, так и потребительский, а вложения в основной капитал выросли почти на 7,5% за год. \nПредседатель правительства также отметил, что Россия входит в четверку крупнейших экономик мира по паритету покупательной способности, добавил он.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, Россия заняла третье место по темпам роста ВВП среди стран G20. Министр экономического развития Максим Решетников заявлял, что Россия имеет потенциал для ежегодного роста ВВП на три процента. В 2024 году ВВП России достиг исторического максимума.\nВладимир Зеленский в интервью журналу Time признал, что украинский бюджет не способен в полном объеме финансировать вооруженные силы страны.\nОн подчеркнул, что армия Украины значительно увеличилась в размерах, стала «в три раза больше, чем была», и ее содержание требует дополнительных ресурсов. Зеленский заявил, что ВСУ нужны отдых, ротация, резервы, зарплаты.\n«Нужны отдельные программы. Европа должна это финансировать. В идеале – Европа и Америка», – считает глава киевского режима.\nОн также отметил, что в текущих условиях он больше рассчитывает на помощь со стороны Европы.\nВладимир Зеленский потребовал предоставить Киеву ядерное оружие в случае отказа от приема Украины в НАТО, чтобы иметь возможность остановить Россию. \nСпецпосланник США Ричард Гренелл заявил, что ядерное оружие, от которого Украина отказалась в рамках Будапештского меморандума, принадлежало России. \nРанее планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС. \nМосква выразила надежду, что США услышали слова президента России Владимира Путина о прекращении военной помощи Киеву как ключевом условии для мирного урегулирования конфликта.\nДиректор Театра Вахтангова Крок заявил об отказе сотрудничать с Ефремовым\nTекст: Дарья Григоренко\nКрок заявил, что ДТП с участием актера в 2020 году, в результате которого погиб человек, стало закономерным итогом его деградации. «Я его совершенно не знаю. Но то, что я видел, когда он был артистом театра «Современник», выходил поддатый где-то на гастролях, не мог двух слов связать, для меня было каким-то ужасом», – сказал Крок. \nОн также отметил, что театр не нуждается в услугах приглашенных артистов, в том числе Ефремова, поскольку у театра большая труппа, передает Lenta.Ru.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова. Позже адвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nАмериканским спецслужбам, включая Центральное разведывательное управление (ЦРУ) и другие агентства, разрешено использовать мессенджер Signal в рабочих целях, сообщает ТАСС, об этом заявил директор ЦРУ Джон Рэтклифф на слушаниях в специальном комитете по разведке Сената Конгресса США. Он подчеркнул, что использование Signal законно, если принимаемые решения документируются официальными каналами.\nРэтклифф подтвердил свое участие в обсуждении через Signal военных операций в Йемене пару недель назад. Вокруг этого события разгорелся скандал, когда в чат по ошибке был добавлен главный редактор журнала Atlantic Джеффри Голдберг, который позже написал статью о случившемся. Рэтклифф заверил, что обсуждения в мессенджере не включали секретную информацию.\nОн также сообщил, что мессенджер Signal был установлен на его рабочий компьютер вскоре после утверждения его кандидатуры на пост директора ЦРУ. Такая практика существовала и при предыдущей администрации Джо Байдена. Директор национальной разведки Тулси Габбард подтвердила, что в Signal не было обмена секретными данными, подчеркнув это утверждение на слушаниях.\nНапомним, члены администрации президента США Дональда Трампа случайно добавили журналиста в незащищенный чат, где обсуждали военные планы по операции против хуситов в Йемене. Издание The Guardian сообщало, что утечка из этого чата показала неприязнь Трампа к Европе.\nТрамп раскритиковал ЕС и пообещал минимум исключений для тарифов со 2 апреля\nTекст: Александра Юдина\nПрезидент США отметил, что считает, будто страна была «мягкой и слабой» в экономических вопросах, что привело к накоплению государственного долга в размере 36 трлн долларов, передает Newsmax.\nПо его мнению, пришло время вернуть часть этих денег. Особенно он выделил страны Европейского союза, заявив, что они нанесли США больше вреда, чем враги. \nТрамп заявил о введении жестких тарифных мер, которые начнут действовать 2 апреля. Он подчеркнул, что не планирует делать много исключений. \n«Посмотрите, нас грабили на протяжении 45 лет другие страны», – сказал он. \nТрамп также напомнил о временном приостановлении тарифов для Канады и Мексики, подчеркнув, что это исключение временно и не будет распространяться на другие страны. \nОн добавил, что действия ЕС и Китая в экономической сфере были особенно разрушительными для американской экономики.\nРанее глава МИД России Лавров раскритиковал «всяких макронов, стармеров и фондерляйенов».\nНапомним, планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nПо словам Меркачевой, зарплата Ефремова составляла около 10 тыс. рублей в месяц , передает ТАСС.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова.\nАдвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nКак сообщает ТАСС, МИД РФ заявил о невозможности передачи Запорожской АЭС Украине или любой другой стране. В заявлении отмечается, что возвращение станции в российскую атомную отрасль является свершившимся фактом, который международное сообщество должно признать. Это решение исключает передачу как самой станции, так и контроля над ней другой стороне.\nТакже в МИД РФ подчеркнули недопустимость совместного управления ЗАЭС с любым государством. В ведомстве отметили, что мировая практика не знает таких прецедентов, а полуобщее управление может затруднить обеспечение ядерной безопасности и урегулирование ответственности за ядерный ущерб.\nКроме того, допуск представителей НАТО на ЗАЭС невозможен. На Смоленской площади указали на диверсионный потенциал разведок стран альянса, сотрудничающих с Украиной. Это делает невозможным даже временное присутствие представителей НАТО на станции.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, президент Украины Владимир Зеленский не согласился с предложением президента США Дональда Трампа о передаче контроля над украинскими атомными электростанциями США, при этом США планируют взять под контроль украинские АЭС в рамках сделки, а переход украинских АЭС под контроль США создаст риски для России.\n© 2005 — 2025 ООО Деловая газета «Взгляд».

На этот раз он скрестил санкции и пошлины: если Пекин продолжит покупать венесуэльскую нефть, то получит от США высокие пошлины в наказание. За покупку иранской нефти США впервые наказали китайский НПЗ. Очистка китайского рынка от иранской и венесуэльской нефти на руку России.\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Договоренности о новой сделке по безопасности в Черном море стали главным итогом очередного раунда переговоров между Россией и США в Эр-Рияде. Проект соглашения подразумевает не только полную свободу судоходства в акватории Черного моря, но и снятие целого ряда санкций с России. В чем смысл этих договоренностей и почему администрация Дональда Трампа заинтересована в их реализации? \r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Одной из несостоявшихся сенсаций прошлой недели было сообщение о том, что российский ЗРК С-400 якобы впервые сбил истребитель F-16 ВВС Украины. Эта новость в итоге не была официально подтверждена, и тем не менее некоторые детали позволяют предположить, что Россия действительно взяла крупный военно-технический рубеж в боевой авиации. О чем идет речь?\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Уже «в скором времени», по словам президента США Дональда Трампа, между Киевом и Вашингтоном будет подписано соглашение по редкоземельным металлам (РЗМ). Намерение заключить аналогичный договор с Украиной декларировалось и Евросоюзом. Однако на самом деле Европа способна найти эти ключевые для современной промышленности элементы гораздо ближе, и Украина для этого вовсе не нужна.\r\n\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Спецслужбы Украины продолжают организовывать покушения на видных деятелей России. В этот раз ФСБ удалось предотвратить теракт в отношении митрополита Симферопольского и Крымского Тихона. Эксперты отмечают, что для украинских властей расправы над христианским духовенством стали нормой, а вице-премьер Сербии Александр Вулин назвал покушение атакой на весь православный мир. Какую цель преследовал Киев, планируя это преступление?\r\n\t            Подробности\n\nУкраинская пропаганда прошла путь от тезиса о победе над Россией до необходимости объяснения того, почему большая часть национальных богатств скоро будет в руках американцев.\nПротивостоять неизменной стратегии «разделяй и властвуй» со стороны США и Европы можно только объединяя усилия России и Китая для решения внутренних проблем развития Евразии.\nПо старой украинской традиции, свержение президентов начинается с бунта олигархов. Так было с Януковичем, который начал отжимать активы старых друзей, так было и с Порошенко, который вступил в жесткий конфликт с Коломойским и рядом других крупных бизнесменов. Так, вероятно, будет и с Зеленским.\nВ Германии нашли новое место работы для одиозного министра иностранных дел Анналены Бербок, которая скоро покинет свой пост. Но это место работы, к сожалению, не в Германии.\nРуководство Армении пытается одновременно восстановить отношения с Россией и начать вступление в Евросоюз. Второе неудивительно, а вот первое для Пашиняна странно. Что же такого случилось, что он больше не хочет ссориться?\nПлан главного евродипломата Каи Каллас по срочному обеспечению Украины новым пакетом военной помощи полностью провалился. Это не значит, что Европа окончательно отказалась финансировать конфликт. Это значит, что настало время для унижения Каи Каллас.\nКем представляются телефонные мошенники, что они говорят потенциальным жертвам, какие инструкции просят исполнить и что нельзя делать при общении с ними – в инфографике газеты ВЗГЛЯД.\nПрименение гиперзвуковой ракеты «Орешник» открыло новую эру в сфере вооружений.

Их общая сумма, по протоколам Роскомнадзора, — 32,8 млрд рублей, узнали «Известия». Помимо этого, американская компания должна кредиторам более 50 млрд рублей. И это не учитывая гигантской неустойки за блокировку аккаунтов российских ТВ-каналов. У российской «дочки» американской компании осталось незначительное количество имущества, стоимость которого, по результатам инвентаризации, — около 30 млн рублей. Смогут ли кредиторы вернуть свои средства — в материале «Известий».\nФедеральная служба судебных приставов (ФССП) России взыскала с 2021 года с ООО «Гугл» (российская дочерняя компания Google) 13,4 млрд рублей — это 40% от общей суммы штрафов за нарушение российского законодательства, рассказали «Известиям» в пресс-службе Роскомнадзора. Общая сумма взысканий, наложенных на компанию Google LLC, составляет 32,8 млрд рублей. Из них не оплачено 19,5 млрд рублей, добавили в ведомстве.\nТак, два оборотных штрафа, назначенных в 2021 и 2023 годах, ФССП взыскала в полном объеме: более 7,2 млрд рублей и более 4,6 млрд рублей соответственно, а из штрафа на сумму более 21 млрд рублей, назначенного в 2022 году, взыскано более 1,5 млрд рублей, отметили в ведомстве.\nДобровольно компания оплатила штрафы только лишь на 6 млн рублей в 2021 году и 6 млн в 2022-м.\nНа сегодняшний день Роскомнадзор не ведет с компанией никакого диалога, резюмировали там. Google демонстрирует систематическое пренебрежение российским законодательством, что подтверждается выборочной оплатой штрафов, считает депутат Госдумы Антон Немкин. Такая тактика подрывает доверие к компании и ставит под сомнение ее готовность вести честный бизнес на территории России, отметил он.\n«Известия» направили запрос в американскую корпорацию.\nПерспективы оплаты Google LLC оставшейся части штрафов напрямую зависят от решения головного офиса и наличия свободных денежных средств, которые можно направить в Россию без нарушения санкционного законодательства, объяснил руководитель практики «Антикризис и банкротство» юридической компании «Лемчик, Крупский и Партнеры» Давид Кононов, который знаком с ходом судебного процесса.\n— Сама процедура банкротства подразумевает погашение долгов перед определенными кредиторами, штрафы, наложенные на Google LLC, формально могут быть погашены лишь в рамках имеющихся в России средств. Если у компании нет существенных активов, то реальное исполнение оставшихся взысканий остается под вопросом, — сказал он.\nЮрист отметил, что, по результатам инвентаризации, у российской «дочки» было обнаружено незначительное количество имущества на сумму около 30 млн рублей. Очевидно, что этого не хватит на погашение реестра требований кредиторов, который составляет более 50 млрд рублей. И это не считая гигантских штрафов за блокировку аккаунтов российских ТВ-каналов.\nС момента ухода Google из России в 2022 году у компании накопилась значительная задолженность по исполнению судебных исков. Самый крупный из них был подан российскими телеканалами («Россия 1», Первый канал, «Звезда» и другими), аккаунты которых были заблокированы на YouTube. По изначальному решению суда, американская корпорация должна была разблокировать аккаунты, а за неисполнение полагался штраф в размере 100 тыс. рублей за каждый день неисполнения решения с условием еженедельного увеличения неустойки в два раза. В результате на середину февраля 2025 года сумма штрафа Google только по этому иску достигла 2,86 дуодециллиона рублей — это цифра с 39 нулями.\nНесколько юридических компаний единогласно сходятся во мнении, что получить свои деньги кредиторы смогут только через процедуру субсидиарной ответственности, когда происходит взыскание долга юридического лица с третьих лиц, связанных с ним. Она наступает тогда, когда сам должник не может отвечать по своим долгам.\n— При банкротстве российской «дочки» возможности взыскать долг с глобальной структуры ограничены: суд может пытаться привлечь Google LLC к субсидиарной ответственности. Однако в этом случае процесс будет осложнен международными барьерами и корпоративной обособленностью, — сказал Давид Кононов.\nЮрист рассказал, что в настоящее время конкурсный управляющий российской «дочки» пытается увеличить объем средств для выплаты долгов кредиторам, в том числе и через оспаривание сделок с Google International LLC.\nТак, например, российский суд признал неправомерными выплаты дочерней компании ООО «Гугл» в адрес Google LLC около 9,5 млрд рублей дивидендов в 2021 году и уплату 500 млн рублей налогов. В свою очередь, американская головная компания обратилась в Верховный суд РФ с жалобой и ходатайством о пересмотре решений. Это дело еще рассматривается, добавил он.\nРуководитель отдела судебной защиты Юридического центра «Академ» Софья Симакова сообщила, что пени и неустойки за неуплату долгов и штрафов начисляться не будут, поскольку суд зафиксировал их по состоянию 2023 года, когда российская «дочка» была признана банкротом.\nПо ее словам, сегодня имущество дочерней компании уходит на оплату текущих платежей, к которым в том числе отнесены суммы насчитанных процентов. Имущества критично мало для погашения всех требований, подчеркнула юрист, поэтому вопрос может решиться только через субсидиарную ответственность.\nВ целом, шансы российской «дочки» полностью оплатить оставшиеся штрафы можно назвать совсем незначительными, заявил «Известиям» руководитель направления «Разрешение It&Ip споров» юрфирмы «Рустам Курмаев и партнеры» Ярослав Шицле. По его мнению, взыскание долга с головной компании даже через процедуру субсидиарной ответственности тоже маловероятно в условиях геополитической напряженности.\n\n                            Авторское право на систему визуализации содержимого портала iz.ru, а также на исходные данные, включая тексты, фотографии, аудио- и видеоматериалы, графические изображения, иные произведения и товарные знаки принадлежит ООО «МИЦ «Известия».

Smartphone manufacturers are aware of the same and offer something called an “extended warranty.” Google also offers the same under the name “Preferred Care.” The company has long offered the extended warranty as a monthly plan, but it’s adding a new option for Google Pixel users.\nAs noted by Android Authority, Google has updated its Preferred Care support page. The updated page includes a new 2-year extended warranty plan for Pixel devices with a one-time payment option. Google notes that the “Preferred Care 2-year plan is currently only available for devices purchased in the US, Canada, UK, and Japan.”\nThe extended warranty plan covers the Pixel 7 and newer devices. Pixel Tablet, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Watch 3 users can purchase the Preferred Care 2-year plan.\nThe 2-year plan for the Pixel 7a, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro costs $99, $149, and $199, respectively. The same plan for Pixel 8a, Pixel 8, and Pixel 8 Pro will set you back by $109, $159, and $249, respectively. Finally, you’ll pay $159, $249, and $279 to get the new warranty plan for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro/Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold/ Pixel Fold, respectively.\nMoving on, Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 3 users have to pay $89 for the plan. Whereas, the same plan will cost $99 for Pixel Tablet users. Do note that the plan will cost differently for users in the UK, Japan, and Canada.\nGoogle, also notes that “if your device is shipped on or after February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Asurion Warranty Protection Services, LLC, or one of its affiliates.” For the devices shipped before the quoted date, Assurant, Google’s previous partner, will be the insurance provider.\nCopyright ©2025 Android Headlines.

Recent reports from cybersecurity firms Mandiant and ProofPoint reveal a 300% spike in these attacks since January 2025, targeting everyone from casual web surfers to corporate IT departments.

Use real-time scanning and heuristic analysis.\nQ: Are Macs/iPhones at risk?\nA: Yes—macOS and iOS malware like XLoader can spread via PDFs.\nQ: How do hackers profit?\nA: Stolen data is sold on dark web forums; ransoms average $250,000 per attack.\nQ: Can I recover encrypted files without paying?\nA: Sometimes. Check the No More Ransom Project for free decryption tools.\nQ: Are password-protected PDFs safer?\nA: No—hackers use tools like BrutePDF to crack weak passwords.\nAs AI-generated CAPTCHAs and deepfake PDF content improve, distinguishing real from fake will only get harder. Proactive defense—not just detection—is critical.\nFake CAPTCHA and PDF scams are a reminder: hackers weaponize trust.

            "full_content": "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\nFor the last few years, tech companies have been telling a pretty simple story to investors: that their technology will be able to automate a lot of tasks, including joblike tasks; that their AI will continue to get more powerful and sophisticated; that they need a lot of money, sure, but that if they succeed, the upside is basically infinite. In the narrow sense, it’s a pretty good pitch that has allowed these companies to raise many billions of dollars. The problem is that this is money talking to money — big new companies talking to big old companies about efficiency and productivity and cost-saving and returns. In other words, it doesn’t really translate. To people outside of a small elite loop, the prospect of automating jobs at a level that justifies epochal levels of investment might fall somewhere between boring and threatening.\nFor the general public, tech companies need a better story than “we’re coming for all the jobs,” which probably explains why they’re doing so many ads. For the second Super Bowl in a row, viewers saw multiple AI spots from tech firms, this time including Google, Meta, and, in a first for the company, OpenAI. Microsoft and Apple have been working out their marketing messages for a while now, too, with promotional videos and TV spots and social-media clips galore. The products they’re advertising are similar — general-purpose AI tools that can answer questions and generate media for you — but their approaches have been fairly different. OpenAI’s ad was a broad brand-awareness campaign in the long tradition of vague and self-serious ads from large firms — tech, pharma, chemical, whatever — that portray their products as broadly synonymous with human progress. (It also bears a passing resemblance to a Guinness send-up of such ads from nearly two decades ago):\nA Microsoft ad from the last Super Bowl positioned AI as a force for individual professional empowerment, suggesting that the benefits of mass automation might accrue not just to AI providers like Microsoft but to early-adopting individuals, too:\nA more recent Apple Intelligence ad tells a similar story, except about assholes who suck at their jobs:\nThis year, Google returned to its strategy of making tear-jerking vignettes about things like “being alive” and “having a family.” In its Super Bowl ad, a stay-at-home dad rehearses his first job interview in years with Gemini. Like the Microsoft ads, this one is  about how AI automation might be used by rather than on workers, and like previous Google ads, it’s stirring. That said, if I were trying to figure out how to reframe mass automation as individually empowering and counter growing unease about AI’s effect on jobs, I might not invite viewers to dwell too much on late-career unemployment and job-hunting:\nAmazon’s automation pitch, in the form of its first promotional video for a major update to Alexa, is more focused, combining a general chatbot ad with a pitch for automation in the home, in both the “turn off your lights with your voice” sense and the “imagine your home and family as a more efficient business” sense:\nMeta, for its part, leaned into the simplest pitch for consumer AI — a pitch that chatbots are pretty good at making themselves, once you try one: Here’s a computer you can talk to, and which will generate text and images for you. Taking into account Meta’s market position, though, the pitch might be a bit closer to: Hey, we have a ChatGPT, too. And a Google, sort of! (It also contains by far the weirdest specific example of AI use in any of these ads, in which a young man visiting Little Italy with his grandfather asks Meta AI to generate an image of the neighborhood in the ’50s. Elder abuse!)\nThese are very different ads from very different companies that rather suddenly found themselves competing in the same space. None of these companies seems quite sure about how to repackage an enterprise product — knowledge-work automation — as a consumer good, but they’re certainly trying. That the companies making them, or the ad agencies tasked with making them, aren’t quite sure what they’re saying is the main thing they have in common. One thing they are collectively discovering, though, is what sorts of stories about AI people really don’t want to hear. During the Olympics, Google released, and then quickly pulled, an ad in which a father asks AI to help his daughter write a fan letter to her favorite athlete:\nMore recently, it was Apple’s turn. In addition to ads about being sort of lazy at work, we’ve gotten one  about how AI can fake a thoughtful gift for a forgotten birthday:\nAnd one about how it might help suppress your rage in the office:\nAnd another about how it might help you, a threatening misanthrope, pass for normal with neighbors you despise:\nWriting Tools can help you sound friendly, even if you're not feeling friendly. Apple Intelligence now on iPhone 16.\nGoogle’s ad is sentimental, while Apple’s are attempts at humor, and in the grand scheme of AI adoption, neither campaign is likely to matter. But it’s telling that the AI ads that have gotten the most backlash aren’t the ones explicitly about  employment or entrepreneurship. Instead, it’s the ones that take the experience of being a person as a sort of job itself — the ones that reveal that, to companies building broad automation technology, everything looks like a job in need of optimization. People are worried about what AI might mean for their work. Maybe they’re just as worried about what it portends for everything else.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission."

            "full_content": "Google LLC ha podido, por fin, cerrar un acuerdo para adquirir\na la firma israelí de ciberseguridad Wiz. Decimos\npor fin, porque hace casi un año los planes iniciales de\nadquisición por parte de Google habían fracasado.\nPero ahora se indica que, después de que el presidente\nestadounidense Donald Trump asumiera el cargo,\nesta adquisición no solo se ha acelerado, sino que se ha llevado\nacabo.\nFue en julio de 2024, cuando Google había mejorado su oferta\noriginal de 23.000 millones de dólares a 32.000 millones para\nintentar completar la adquisición. Esta se trata ya de una\nde las mayores operaciones tecnológicas de la historia. Si\nbien la cuantía aumentó considerablemente, fuentes familiarizadas\ncon el acuerdo, indicaron que este acuerdo llega tras el\nmandado de Donald Trump. Indicándose que la Casa Blanca\ntrajo consigo la perspectiva de una revisión antimonopolio más\nfavorable bajo su mandato.\nGoogle no solo mejoró su oferta inicial para adquirir a Wiz. La\ncompañía también aumentó considerablemente una tarifa de\nruptura inversa de 3.200 millones de dólares, o más del\n10% del valor del acuerdo. Dinero que se le pagaría a Wiz\nsi el acuerdo fracasara, por lo que Google debe\nestar muy segura que esta adquisición llegará a buen puerto. Es\ndecir, esperan que los reguladores antimonopolio no se opongan a la\nadquisición. En este caso, Google puede pagar una tarifa de\nterminación inversa, más comúnmente llamadas tarifas de ruptura. Es\nuna forma de seguro para compensar a las empresas objetivo de\ncompra cuando los acuerdos fracasan debido a razones\nregulatorias.\nUna comisión de ruptura tan elevada no es habitual en\nlas transacciones corporativas en Estados Unidos. Según un\nestudio del bufete Fenwick & West, que revisó acuerdos por un valor\nde al menos 1.000 millones de dólares firmados en 2023, las\ncomisiones de ruptura oscilaron, en promedio, entre el 4 %\ny el 7 % del valor total de la transacción. No está claro\nsi ambas compañías se acercaron a las autoridades antimonopolio de\nEstados Unidos antes de la firma del acuerdo. Google considera que\nla prima está justificada dado el crecimiento anual del\n70% de los ingresos de Wiz y más de 700 millones de\ndólares en ingresos anualizados.\nLos ejecutivos de Wiz se mostraron cautelosos después de ver a\nAdobe fracasar en su intento de adquisición de Figma por 20.000\nmillones de dólares. Y sí, fue debido al escrutinio antimonopolio.\nA ello se le suma que Google también enfrenta dos demandas del\nDepartamento de Justicia de EE.UU. por su dominio de las búsquedas\nweb y otra sobre su tecnología publicitaria.\nSegún indica Google, pese a la adquisición de Wiz, se indica que\nla compañía israelí seguirá operando como una compañía\nindependiente. Recalcando que seguirá trabajando con las\nplataformas en la nube rivales de Google. Las cuales son Amazon Web\nServices (AWS), Microsoft Azure y Oracle Cloud. Y es que si no\nfuera así, sí existiría un serio problema con el regulador\nantimonopolio. Lo que evidentemente tiraría a la basura los\nesfuerzos de Google de formalizar la adquisición.\n\"Los productos de Wiz seguirán funcionando y estando disponibles\nen las principales nubes, incluidas las plataformas Amazon Web\nServices, Microsoft Azure y Oracle Cloud, y se ofrecerán a los\nclientes a través de una serie de soluciones de seguridad de\nsocios. Google Cloud también seguirá ofreciendo a los clientes una\namplia gama de opciones a través de una variedad de soluciones de\nseguridad de socios disponibles en Google Cloud Marketplace\".\nEsta información fue ofrecida después de indicar que\nGoogle Cloud es líder en infraestructura en la\nnube, con una profunda experiencia en IA y un\nhistorial de innovación en seguridad líder en el sector. Por lo que\nes lógico pensar que incentiven también el uso de su\nplataforma.\nAportar todo esto a Wiz ayudará a que sus soluciones sean aún\nmejores y más escalables, lo que beneficiará a clientes y socios de\nlas principales nubes. La combinación de Google Cloud y Wiz\npermitirá:"

В случае нарушения одной из сторон обязательств, другая сторона вправе считать себя свободной от их соблюдения.\nРанее в Кремле сообщили, что Россия и США на встрече в Эр-Рияде договорились о реализации «Черноморской инициативы», включающей меры по безопасности судоходства и запрет ударов по энергетическим объектам на 30 дней. \nБелый дом опубликовал заявление по итогам встречи экспертных групп России и США в Эр-Рияде 23–25 марта.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nКак передает ТАСС, лесной массив у Гуева в Курской области заминирован украинскими военнослужащими, что создает препятствия как для продвижения российских сил, так и для отступления самих ВСУ. В результате этого ВСУ оказались заперты в лесу, не имея возможности отойти в сторону Сумской области, откуда они изначально пришли. \nРоссийские силовые структуры заявляют, что продолжают уничтожать врага в лесных массивах, где еще остаются группы украинских военных.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, украинские военные начали хаотично минировать поля в Запорожской области, опасаясь прорыва российских войск, дистанционно заминировали гражданские объекты в Курской области, а также устанавливали мины в квартирах при отступлении из Новогродовки.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\n«Министерство обороны над этим думает, и, конечно, этот вопрос стоит остро. Безусловно, его не забываем. Но исходить будем из реалий, которые складываются на линии боевого соприкосновения», – сказал президент, передает ТАСС. Так он ответил на соответствующий вопрос писателя Захара Прилепина.\nПрезидент подчеркнул, что многие из мобилизованных стали реально профессиональными военными: «Они – полноценные боевые единицы, они работают как профессионалы рядом со своими боевыми товарищами из профессиональных воинских коллективов».\nТакже в ходе заседания Совета глава государства назвал воспитание молодежи, пробуждение в ней любви к стране одной из важнейших задач общества и государства.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nНа встрече экспертных групп России и США были достигнуты несколько ключевых договоренностей, сообщает Кремль в Telegram-канале. В рамках «Черноморской инициативы» стороны согласовали меры по обеспечению безопасности судоходства в Черном море, неприменению силы и запрету использования коммерческих судов в военных целях. Контроль за соблюдением этих обязательств будет осуществляться посредством досмотра судов.\nСША обязались способствовать восстановлению доступа российского экспорта сельскохозяйственной продукции и удобрений на мировой рынок. Это включает в себя снижение стоимости страхования морских перевозок и расширение доступа к международным портам и платежным системам.\nОднако реализация этих мер начнется только после выполнения ряда условий. В их числе – отмена санкций в отношении «Россельхозбанка» и других финансовых структур, обеспечивающих торговлю продовольствием и удобрениями, восстановление их подключения к SWIFT и открытие необходимых корреспондентских счетов.\nТакже необходимо снятие ограничений на торговое финансирование и на деятельность российских производителей и экспортеров продовольствия, включая рыбопродукцию. Помимо этого, требуется разблокировать возможность страхования грузов, обслуживать в портах российские суда, задействованные в торговле продовольствием и удобрениями, а также снять запреты на поставку в Россию сельскохозяйственной техники и других товаров, критически важных для агропромышленного сектора.\nРоссия и США согласились разработать меры по запрету ударов по объектам энергетики сроком на тридцать суток, начиная с 18 марта 2025 года, с возможностью продления. Стороны также выразили готовность принимать помощь третьих стран в поддержке данных договоренностей.\n Обе стороны заявили о намерении продолжать работу по достижению прочного и продолжительного мира, укрепляя двусторонние соглашения в энергетической и морской сферах.\nНапомним, переговоры делегаций России и США в Эр-Рияде длились более 12 часов.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nПо его словам, российская экономика второй год подряд демонстрирует темпы роста, которые вдвое превышают среднемировые показатели, сообщает ТАСС. Мишустин отметил, что рост отечественной экономики в шесть раз опережает европейский. \n«А в ряде этих государств уже наблюдается рецессия. Например, экономика Германии все это время сокращается», – добавил он. \nПремьер-министр подчеркнул, что ВВП России по итогам 2024 года достиг 200 трлн рублей, увеличившись почти вдвое с 2020 года. Он отметил, что локомотивом такого роста стал внутренний спрос, как инвестиционный, так и потребительский, а вложения в основной капитал выросли почти на 7,5% за год. \nПредседатель правительства также отметил, что Россия входит в четверку крупнейших экономик мира по паритету покупательной способности, добавил он.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, Россия заняла третье место по темпам роста ВВП среди стран G20. Министр экономического развития Максим Решетников заявлял, что Россия имеет потенциал для ежегодного роста ВВП на три процента. В 2024 году ВВП России достиг исторического максимума.\nВладимир Зеленский в интервью журналу Time признал, что украинский бюджет не способен в полном объеме финансировать вооруженные силы страны.\nОн подчеркнул, что армия Украины значительно увеличилась в размерах, стала «в три раза больше, чем была», и ее содержание требует дополнительных ресурсов. Зеленский заявил, что ВСУ нужны отдых, ротация, резервы, зарплаты.\n«Нужны отдельные программы. Европа должна это финансировать. В идеале – Европа и Америка», – считает глава киевского режима.\nОн также отметил, что в текущих условиях он больше рассчитывает на помощь со стороны Европы.\nВладимир Зеленский потребовал предоставить Киеву ядерное оружие в случае отказа от приема Украины в НАТО, чтобы иметь возможность остановить Россию. \nСпецпосланник США Ричард Гренелл заявил, что ядерное оружие, от которого Украина отказалась в рамках Будапештского меморандума, принадлежало России. \nРанее планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС. \nМосква выразила надежду, что США услышали слова президента России Владимира Путина о прекращении военной помощи Киеву как ключевом условии для мирного урегулирования конфликта.\nДиректор Театра Вахтангова Крок заявил об отказе сотрудничать с Ефремовым\nTекст: Дарья Григоренко\nКрок заявил, что ДТП с участием актера в 2020 году, в результате которого погиб человек, стало закономерным итогом его деградации. «Я его совершенно не знаю. Но то, что я видел, когда он был артистом театра «Современник», выходил поддатый где-то на гастролях, не мог двух слов связать, для меня было каким-то ужасом», – сказал Крок. \nОн также отметил, что театр не нуждается в услугах приглашенных артистов, в том числе Ефремова, поскольку у театра большая труппа, передает Lenta.Ru.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова. Позже адвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nАмериканским спецслужбам, включая Центральное разведывательное управление (ЦРУ) и другие агентства, разрешено использовать мессенджер Signal в рабочих целях, сообщает ТАСС, об этом заявил директор ЦРУ Джон Рэтклифф на слушаниях в специальном комитете по разведке Сената Конгресса США. Он подчеркнул, что использование Signal законно, если принимаемые решения документируются официальными каналами.\nРэтклифф подтвердил свое участие в обсуждении через Signal военных операций в Йемене пару недель назад. Вокруг этого события разгорелся скандал, когда в чат по ошибке был добавлен главный редактор журнала Atlantic Джеффри Голдберг, который позже написал статью о случившемся. Рэтклифф заверил, что обсуждения в мессенджере не включали секретную информацию.\nОн также сообщил, что мессенджер Signal был установлен на его рабочий компьютер вскоре после утверждения его кандидатуры на пост директора ЦРУ. Такая практика существовала и при предыдущей администрации Джо Байдена. Директор национальной разведки Тулси Габбард подтвердила, что в Signal не было обмена секретными данными, подчеркнув это утверждение на слушаниях.\nНапомним, члены администрации президента США Дональда Трампа случайно добавили журналиста в незащищенный чат, где обсуждали военные планы по операции против хуситов в Йемене. Издание The Guardian сообщало, что утечка из этого чата показала неприязнь Трампа к Европе.\nТрамп раскритиковал ЕС и пообещал минимум исключений для тарифов со 2 апреля\nTекст: Александра Юдина\nПрезидент США отметил, что считает, будто страна была «мягкой и слабой» в экономических вопросах, что привело к накоплению государственного долга в размере 36 трлн долларов, передает Newsmax.\nПо его мнению, пришло время вернуть часть этих денег. Особенно он выделил страны Европейского союза, заявив, что они нанесли США больше вреда, чем враги. \nТрамп заявил о введении жестких тарифных мер, которые начнут действовать 2 апреля. Он подчеркнул, что не планирует делать много исключений. \n«Посмотрите, нас грабили на протяжении 45 лет другие страны», – сказал он. \nТрамп также напомнил о временном приостановлении тарифов для Канады и Мексики, подчеркнув, что это исключение временно и не будет распространяться на другие страны. \nОн добавил, что действия ЕС и Китая в экономической сфере были особенно разрушительными для американской экономики.\nРанее глава МИД России Лавров раскритиковал «всяких макронов, стармеров и фондерляйенов».\nНапомним, планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nПо словам Меркачевой, зарплата Ефремова составляла около 10 тыс. рублей в месяц , передает ТАСС.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова.\nАдвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nКак сообщает ТАСС, МИД РФ заявил о невозможности передачи Запорожской АЭС Украине или любой другой стране. В заявлении отмечается, что возвращение станции в российскую атомную отрасль является свершившимся фактом, который международное сообщество должно признать. Это решение исключает передачу как самой станции, так и контроля над ней другой стороне.\nТакже в МИД РФ подчеркнули недопустимость совместного управления ЗАЭС с любым государством. В ведомстве отметили, что мировая практика не знает таких прецедентов, а полуобщее управление может затруднить обеспечение ядерной безопасности и урегулирование ответственности за ядерный ущерб.\nКроме того, допуск представителей НАТО на ЗАЭС невозможен. На Смоленской площади указали на диверсионный потенциал разведок стран альянса, сотрудничающих с Украиной. Это делает невозможным даже временное присутствие представителей НАТО на станции.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, президент Украины Владимир Зеленский не согласился с предложением президента США Дональда Трампа о передаче контроля над украинскими атомными электростанциями США, при этом США планируют взять под контроль украинские АЭС в рамках сделки, а переход украинских АЭС под контроль США создаст риски для России.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nГлава государства подписал соответствующий указ, передает ТАСС.

На этот раз он скрестил санкции и пошлины: если Пекин продолжит покупать венесуэльскую нефть, то получит от США высокие пошлины в наказание.

Намерение заключить аналогичный договор с Украиной декларировалось и Евросоюзом. Однако на самом деле Европа способна найти эти ключевые для современной промышленности элементы гораздо ближе, и Украина для этого вовсе не нужна.\r\n\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Спецслужбы Украины продолжают организовывать покушения на видных деятелей России.

Эксперты отмечают, что для украинских властей расправы над христианским духовенством стали нормой, а вице-премьер Сербии Александр Вулин назвал покушение атакой на весь православный мир.

            "full_content": "Senior Contributor. \nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 28: Director Gino McKoy attends \"LUMINA\" LA Premiere at Television ... More Academy on June 28, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Luminamovie LLC)\nAs we wait in anticipation of the final season of Netflix’s Stranger Things (almost three years have passed since the season four finale), there is a film called Lumina from Gino McKoy currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, and YouTube to ease the delay. There is no Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Hopper, Joyce, or the rest of the residents of the fictional Hawkins, Indiana. However, it does feature a group of modern-day young adults as they embark on a journey for the truth where they encounter unexpected challenges. And it is just enough to whet your appetite for what lies ahead on Stranger Things. \n From Goldove Entertainment, Lumina tells the tale of a young woman named Tatiana (Eleanor Williams) who disappears following a sudden flash of light from the sky and the attempts by her boyfriend Alex (Rupert Lazarus) and his friends to find her. The group desperately treks from Los Angeles to the desert in search of Tatiana, who Alex believes is being held in a Deep Underground Military Base (DUMB) after having contact with alien forces. There they meet Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts as the mysterious Thom. And what they discover is a dystopian future where humanity has harnessed a mysterious energy source known as Lumina, which for reasons unknown is trying to solve the world’s energy crisis.\nShades of Stranger Things, there are mysterious human and extraterrestrial forces beyond comprehension in the search for Tatiana in Lumina. Blending elements of psychological thrillers, science fiction, and horror, the set designs and special effects enhance the narrative. Lumina is the first science fiction entry to be shot in Morocco, particularly in the mountainous regions of Marrakech and Ouarzazate, providing it with a distinct cinematic appearance. And, debuting in theaters in 2024, the film has been showcased at packed fan gatherings like Comic Con New York and Monsterpalooza.\n\"Lumina,\" a science fiction horror-themed dramedy, follows the story of Alex, whose girlfriend ... More Tatiana disappears in a flash of a blinding light.\n“At first, I wanted to do a sci-fi comedy, but I also wanted to show what the impact is psychologically following an abduction,” noted Gino McKoy, who wrote, produced and directed Lumina. “The film is tongue in cheek at times, but it deals with serious topics and unexplained phenomena. At the core, this is a story of reality, love, and survival. And because it was a mixture of different genres, it took some convincing to explain what my vision was for the film.”\n “It dares to be different,” he said. From the Beginning\n Born in Trinidad and raised in Canada, show business was in Gino McKoy’s roots. His parents, Hudson and Lynda McKoy, are musicians, banking professionals and the founders of Goldove Entertainment, and McKoy’s entry into the business and entertainment space mirrored his family’s path. \n “I majored in political science in college, which was always one of my great interests. And I studied world religion, specializing in Judaism and Christianity,” he said. “I also had classical training and grew up surrounded by music. But after entering the business world working for a financial institution, my creative side took over and I eventually segued into music and filmmaking. I wanted to perform and produce the type of music I could include in my movies, which I do throughout Lumina.”\n In 2008, McKoy’s career in music got a boost after he met Canadian sound engineer/producer Nick Blagona and they began to work on his debut pop rock album. In 2010, the project was taken over by legendary Hollywood producer David Kershenbaum, which resulted in his debut album Step Forward. \n “I had the opportunity to compete on America’s Got Talent, but I did not want to sing anybody else’s music. I didn’t want to portray myself as a cover artist,” he said. \n At the same time, McKoy started working on screenplays for two feature films, while also launching a merchandising line, Lydgio Fashions, co-founded by he and his mother, Lynda. Then, in 2015, McKoy wrote the script for Little Mizz Innocent, which followed a UN interpreter entangled in a conflict between the FBI and a criminal organization.\n “With Lumina, we initially had a distribution deal with Byron Allen’s Entertainment Studios for a wide release, but Covid hit and everything was put on hold,” remembered McKoy. “So, we spoke to other investors we knew and I started scouting locations where we could safely shoot the film, which ended up being Morocco.\n Not without its hiccups, including the pandemic-related delays and a cast and crew turnover, getting Lumina off the ground was a no easy maneuver. In addition to writing, directing, producing and singing the songs in the film, McKoy co-composed the soundtrack and served as visual effects supervisor. \n “Overall, it’s been a mixed response. Some people don’t understand Lumina and I think some of the critics unfairly misjudged it because this is a sci-fi comedy. Everything was intentional when I set up scenes and,” he said. “I grew up in the days where you had movies like The Naked Gun, Blazing Saddles and Billy Crystal in City Slickers. And I wanted something lighter, something funny in a parody sense, and all with a bit of a love interest in there.”\n“When I go to an event like Comic Con, I realize that people saw the experimentation. They felt the vibe. And that is what I want to accomplish with any film I do,” he said.\nAt present, McKoy is collaborating with Michael Sloan (The Equalizer) to produce a new film, Spidersweb, set to begin shooting in Morocco. Also in the science fiction space, Spidersweb, per McKoy, is about a “post-apocalyptic future where time travelers are banned and discover an alien race.”\n Also in the planning stages at Goldove Entertainment are a sci-fi flick about a scientist that creates the first anti-gravity spacecraft, a biopic about former football executive Jack Warner, and a sports film showcasing Howard University in the early 1970s, the first African American college to win a soccer championship. \n “The first black coach to win that collegiate championship at that point in time in the history of the country happens to be from Trinidad and Tobago, which are my roots. I felt an immediate connection,” noted McKoy. “I'm directing and writing the script and Spike Lee is executive producing it.”\n “Basically, I don't want to pigeonhole or typecast myself into one type of genre, so I continue to seek a diversified array of projects,” he said. “And I will always still pursue music. There’s much to accomplish!”"

Так было с Януковичем, который начал отжимать активы старых друзей, так было и с Порошенко, который вступил в жесткий конфликт с Коломойским и рядом других крупных бизнесменов. Так, вероятно, будет и с Зеленским.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\nGoogle LLC признали виновной по статье «Неисполнение владельцем социальной сети обязанности по осуществлению мониторинга и (или) принятию мер по ограничению доступа к информации», передает ТАСС.\nКомпании назначили штраф в 3,5 млн рублей.\nРанее заместитель главы Роскомнадзора Вадим Субботин заявил, что российский регулятор более не ведет диалог с Google и X.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\nВ результате действий группировки «Запад» освобожден населенный пункт Мирное в ДНР, указало ведомство в своем Telegram-канале. Группировка «Днепр» освободила населенный пункт Малые Щербаки в Запорожской области.\nПоражены формирования ВСУ в районах Харьковской области и ДНР, украинская сторона потеряла более 250 человек и технику. \nНа Белгородском направлении группировка «Север» поразила живую силу и технику ВСУ у Угроедов, Мирополья и Краснополья, украинская армия потеряла до 50 военнослужащих и несколько единиц техники. \nВ зоне ответственности подразделений «Южной» группировки ВСУ потеряли до 200 человек и значительное количество техники. \nВ зоне действия группировки «Центр» украинская армия потеряла до 430 военнослужащих. В зоне ответственности группировки «Восток» ВСУ потеряли более 140 человек, три ББМ, французскую САУ Caesar. \nРанее в ДНР освободили населенный пункт Срибное. За прошлую неделю российские войска освободили несколько населенных пунктов в Курской и Запорожской областях,\nСпецпосланник Гренелл: Ядерное оружие, от которого отказался Киев, принадлежало России\nTекст: Денис Тельманов\nПосланник президента США по особым поручениям Ричард Гренелл заявил, что ядерное оружие, от которого Украина отказалась после распада СССР, изначально принадлежало России. Об этом пишет ТАСС. \n«Давайте внесем ясность относительно Будапештского меморандума: ядерное оружие принадлежало России, и это были остатки», – заявил Гренелл.\nОн добавил, что Украина вернула это ядерное оружие России, подчеркнув, что оно не было украинским: «Это неудобный факт», – подытожил он. \nБудапештский меморандум был подписан Россией, Украиной, США и Британией 5 декабря 1994 года и предоставлял Киеву гарантии безопасности в обмен на отказ от ядерного арсенала и присоединение к Договору о нераспространении ядерного оружия (ДНЯО).\nТогдашний ядерный арсенал, оставшийся после распада СССР на Украине, включал значительное количество зарядов и средств доставки, что делало ее третьей по ядерному потенциалу после США и России.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, глава киевского режима Владимир Зеленский требовал от США обещания ядерного удара по России в случае необходимости для обеспечения мира на Украине.\nВоенкор Первого канала Анна Прокофьева погибла на вражеской мине в Белгородской области\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nВоенный корреспондент Первого канала Анна Прокофьева погибла в Белгородской области при выполнении журналистских обязанностей, передает ТАСС. Инцидент произошел на границе с Украиной, когда съемочная группа наткнулась на вражескую мину. В результате взрыва Анна Прокофьева погибла, а оператор Дмитрий Волков получил ранения.\nПрокофьевой было 35 лет. Она окончила Российский университет дружбы народов по специальности «журналистика» и свободно владела испанским языком. С сентября 2020 года по ноябрь 2022-го Прокофьева работала в испанской редакции агентства Sputnik. В этот период она вела Telegram-блог для сбора гуманитарной помощи и после ухода из Sputnik продолжила доставлять ее в зону СВО.\nВ 2023 году она начала свою работу на Первом канале как военный корреспондент, освещая события из зоны специальной военной операции. Анна вела Telegram-канал Журналистка | Z |, вот ее последняя публикация:\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, оператор телеканала «Звезда» Андрей Панов, водитель Александр Сиркели и военный корреспондент «Известий» Александр Федорчак погибли в зоне СВО в результате ракетного удара ВСУ по гражданской машине.\n В редакции «Известий» появился мемориал в память о погибшем военкоре Федорчаке. \nОфициальный представитель МИД России Мария Захарова осудила Киев за убийство российских журналистов в ЛНР.\nКремль опубликовал список подпадающих под мораторий на удары по энергосистеме объектов\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nПо информации из Telegram-канала Кремля, в список вошли нефтеперерабатывающие предприятия, нефте- и газопроводы, хранилища и насосные станции.\n Также под действие моратория попадают вырабатывающая и передающая электричество инфраструктура, включая электростанции, подстанции, трансформаторы и распределители. Кроме того, временным соглашением защищены атомные электростанции и дамбы гидроэлектростанций.\n Мораторий вступает в силу задним числом – с 18 марта 2025 года и будет действовать 30 суток. Стороны оставляют за собой возможность продлить соглашение по взаимной договоренности. В случае нарушения одной из сторон обязательств, другая сторона вправе считать себя свободной от их соблюдения.\nРанее в Кремле сообщили, что Россия и США на встрече в Эр-Рияде договорились о реализации «Черноморской инициативы», включающей меры по безопасности судоходства и запрет ударов по энергетическим объектам на 30 дней. \nБелый дом опубликовал заявление по итогам встречи экспертных групп России и США в Эр-Рияде 23–25 марта.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nКак передает ТАСС, лесной массив у Гуева в Курской области заминирован украинскими военнослужащими, что создает препятствия как для продвижения российских сил, так и для отступления самих ВСУ. В результате этого ВСУ оказались заперты в лесу, не имея возможности отойти в сторону Сумской области, откуда они изначально пришли. \nРоссийские силовые структуры заявляют, что продолжают уничтожать врага в лесных массивах, где еще остаются группы украинских военных.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, украинские военные начали хаотично минировать поля в Запорожской области, опасаясь прорыва российских войск, дистанционно заминировали гражданские объекты в Курской области, а также устанавливали мины в квартирах при отступлении из Новогродовки.\nTекст: Алексей Дегтярев\n«Министерство обороны над этим думает, и, конечно, этот вопрос стоит остро. Безусловно, его не забываем. Но исходить будем из реалий, которые складываются на линии боевого соприкосновения», – сказал президент, передает ТАСС. Так он ответил на соответствующий вопрос писателя Захара Прилепина.\nПрезидент подчеркнул, что многие из мобилизованных стали реально профессиональными военными: «Они – полноценные боевые единицы, они работают как профессионалы рядом со своими боевыми товарищами из профессиональных воинских коллективов».\nТакже в ходе заседания Совета глава государства назвал воспитание молодежи, пробуждение в ней любви к стране одной из важнейших задач общества и государства.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nНа встрече экспертных групп России и США были достигнуты несколько ключевых договоренностей, сообщает Кремль в Telegram-канале. В рамках «Черноморской инициативы» стороны согласовали меры по обеспечению безопасности судоходства в Черном море, неприменению силы и запрету использования коммерческих судов в военных целях. Контроль за соблюдением этих обязательств будет осуществляться посредством досмотра судов.\nСША обязались способствовать восстановлению доступа российского экспорта сельскохозяйственной продукции и удобрений на мировой рынок. Это включает в себя снижение стоимости страхования морских перевозок и расширение доступа к международным портам и платежным системам.\nОднако реализация этих мер начнется только после выполнения ряда условий. В их числе – отмена санкций в отношении «Россельхозбанка» и других финансовых структур, обеспечивающих торговлю продовольствием и удобрениями, восстановление их подключения к SWIFT и открытие необходимых корреспондентских счетов.\nТакже необходимо снятие ограничений на торговое финансирование и на деятельность российских производителей и экспортеров продовольствия, включая рыбопродукцию. Помимо этого, требуется разблокировать возможность страхования грузов, обслуживать в портах российские суда, задействованные в торговле продовольствием и удобрениями, а также снять запреты на поставку в Россию сельскохозяйственной техники и других товаров, критически важных для агропромышленного сектора.\nРоссия и США согласились разработать меры по запрету ударов по объектам энергетики сроком на тридцать суток, начиная с 18 марта 2025 года, с возможностью продления. Стороны также выразили готовность принимать помощь третьих стран в поддержке данных договоренностей.\n Обе стороны заявили о намерении продолжать работу по достижению прочного и продолжительного мира, укрепляя двусторонние соглашения в энергетической и морской сферах.\nНапомним, переговоры делегаций России и США в Эр-Рияде длились более 12 часов.\nTекст: Дмитрий Зубарев\nПо его словам, российская экономика второй год подряд демонстрирует темпы роста, которые вдвое превышают среднемировые показатели, сообщает ТАСС. Мишустин отметил, что рост отечественной экономики в шесть раз опережает европейский. \n«А в ряде этих государств уже наблюдается рецессия. Например, экономика Германии все это время сокращается», – добавил он. \nПремьер-министр подчеркнул, что ВВП России по итогам 2024 года достиг 200 трлн рублей, увеличившись почти вдвое с 2020 года. Он отметил, что локомотивом такого роста стал внутренний спрос, как инвестиционный, так и потребительский, а вложения в основной капитал выросли почти на 7,5% за год. \nПредседатель правительства также отметил, что Россия входит в четверку крупнейших экономик мира по паритету покупательной способности, добавил он.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, Россия заняла третье место по темпам роста ВВП среди стран G20. Министр экономического развития Максим Решетников заявлял, что Россия имеет потенциал для ежегодного роста ВВП на три процента. В 2024 году ВВП России достиг исторического максимума.\nВладимир Зеленский в интервью журналу Time признал, что украинский бюджет не способен в полном объеме финансировать вооруженные силы страны.\nОн подчеркнул, что армия Украины значительно увеличилась в размерах, стала «в три раза больше, чем была», и ее содержание требует дополнительных ресурсов. Зеленский заявил, что ВСУ нужны отдых, ротация, резервы, зарплаты.\n«Нужны отдельные программы. Европа должна это финансировать. В идеале – Европа и Америка», – считает глава киевского режима.\nОн также отметил, что в текущих условиях он больше рассчитывает на помощь со стороны Европы.\nВладимир Зеленский потребовал предоставить Киеву ядерное оружие в случае отказа от приема Украины в НАТО, чтобы иметь возможность остановить Россию. \nСпецпосланник США Ричард Гренелл заявил, что ядерное оружие, от которого Украина отказалась в рамках Будапештского меморандума, принадлежало России. \nРанее планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС. \nМосква выразила надежду, что США услышали слова президента России Владимира Путина о прекращении военной помощи Киеву как ключевом условии для мирного урегулирования конфликта.\nДиректор Театра Вахтангова Крок заявил об отказе сотрудничать с Ефремовым\nTекст: Дарья Григоренко\nКрок заявил, что ДТП с участием актера в 2020 году, в результате которого погиб человек, стало закономерным итогом его деградации. «Я его совершенно не знаю. Но то, что я видел, когда он был артистом театра «Современник», выходил поддатый где-то на гастролях, не мог двух слов связать, для меня было каким-то ужасом», – сказал Крок. \nОн также отметил, что театр не нуждается в услугах приглашенных артистов, в том числе Ефремова, поскольку у театра большая труппа, передает Lenta.Ru.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова. Позже адвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nАмериканским спецслужбам, включая Центральное разведывательное управление (ЦРУ) и другие агентства, разрешено использовать мессенджер Signal в рабочих целях, сообщает ТАСС, об этом заявил директор ЦРУ Джон Рэтклифф на слушаниях в специальном комитете по разведке Сената Конгресса США. Он подчеркнул, что использование Signal законно, если принимаемые решения документируются официальными каналами.\nРэтклифф подтвердил свое участие в обсуждении через Signal военных операций в Йемене пару недель назад. Вокруг этого события разгорелся скандал, когда в чат по ошибке был добавлен главный редактор журнала Atlantic Джеффри Голдберг, который позже написал статью о случившемся. Рэтклифф заверил, что обсуждения в мессенджере не включали секретную информацию.\nОн также сообщил, что мессенджер Signal был установлен на его рабочий компьютер вскоре после утверждения его кандидатуры на пост директора ЦРУ. Такая практика существовала и при предыдущей администрации Джо Байдена. Директор национальной разведки Тулси Габбард подтвердила, что в Signal не было обмена секретными данными, подчеркнув это утверждение на слушаниях.\nНапомним, члены администрации президента США Дональда Трампа случайно добавили журналиста в незащищенный чат, где обсуждали военные планы по операции против хуситов в Йемене. Издание The Guardian сообщало, что утечка из этого чата показала неприязнь Трампа к Европе.\nТрамп раскритиковал ЕС и пообещал минимум исключений для тарифов со 2 апреля\nTекст: Александра Юдина\nПрезидент США отметил, что считает, будто страна была «мягкой и слабой» в экономических вопросах, что привело к накоплению государственного долга в размере 36 трлн долларов, передает Newsmax.\nПо его мнению, пришло время вернуть часть этих денег. Особенно он выделил страны Европейского союза, заявив, что они нанесли США больше вреда, чем враги. \nТрамп заявил о введении жестких тарифных мер, которые начнут действовать 2 апреля. Он подчеркнул, что не планирует делать много исключений. \n«Посмотрите, нас грабили на протяжении 45 лет другие страны», – сказал он. \nТрамп также напомнил о временном приостановлении тарифов для Канады и Мексики, подчеркнув, что это исключение временно и не будет распространяться на другие страны. \nОн добавил, что действия ЕС и Китая в экономической сфере были особенно разрушительными для американской экономики.\nРанее глава МИД России Лавров раскритиковал «всяких макронов, стармеров и фондерляйенов».\nНапомним, планы главы европейской дипломатии Каи Каллас по мобилизации 40 млрд евро на военную помощь Украине провалились из-за разногласий среди стран ЕС.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nПо словам Меркачевой, зарплата Ефремова составляла около 10 тыс. рублей в месяц , передает ТАСС.\nНапомним, в понедельник Алексеевский райсуд Белгородской области удовлетворил прошение об условно-досрочном освобождении Ефремова.\nАдвокат Ефремова Юрий Падалко сообщил, что актер намерен заняться на свободе собственным здоровьем.\nTекст: Ольга Иванова \nКак сообщает ТАСС, МИД РФ заявил о невозможности передачи Запорожской АЭС Украине или любой другой стране. В заявлении отмечается, что возвращение станции в российскую атомную отрасль является свершившимся фактом, который международное сообщество должно признать. Это решение исключает передачу как самой станции, так и контроля над ней другой стороне.\nТакже в МИД РФ подчеркнули недопустимость совместного управления ЗАЭС с любым государством. В ведомстве отметили, что мировая практика не знает таких прецедентов, а полуобщее управление может затруднить обеспечение ядерной безопасности и урегулирование ответственности за ядерный ущерб.\nКроме того, допуск представителей НАТО на ЗАЭС невозможен. На Смоленской площади указали на диверсионный потенциал разведок стран альянса, сотрудничающих с Украиной. Это делает невозможным даже временное присутствие представителей НАТО на станции.\nКак писала газета ВЗГЛЯД, президент Украины Владимир Зеленский не согласился с предложением президента США Дональда Трампа о передаче контроля над украинскими атомными электростанциями США, при этом США планируют взять под контроль украинские АЭС в рамках сделки, а переход украинских АЭС под контроль США создаст риски для России.\nTекст: Валерия Городецкая\nГлава государства подписал соответствующий указ, передает ТАСС. Звание народного артиста России также присвоено актерам Максиму Аверину и Александру Олешко.\nАнна Михалкова родилась в Москве в 1974 году, известна своими ролями в фильмах «Изображая жертву», «Связь», «Кококо» и других. Она также является ведущей программы «Спокойной ночи, малыши!» и ранее получила звание заслуженной артистки России.\nМаксим Аверин, известный по ролям в сериалах «Глухарь» и «Собор», также является режиссером и телеведущим. С 2021 года он занимает должность художественного руководителя Сочинского концертно-филармонического объединения.\nАлександр Олешко известен по ролям в сериале «Папины дочки», фильме «Турецкий гамбит» и других проектах. Имеет звание заслуженного артиста России.\nРанее Путин присвоил актрисе Московского Губернского драматического театра Анне Снаткиной звание заслуженной артистки.\n© 2005 — 2025 ООО Деловая газета «Взгляд».

На этот раз он скрестил санкции и пошлины: если Пекин продолжит покупать венесуэльскую нефть, то получит от США высокие пошлины в наказание. За покупку иранской нефти США впервые наказали китайский НПЗ. Очистка китайского рынка от иранской и венесуэльской нефти на руку России.\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Договоренности о новой сделке по безопасности в Черном море стали главным итогом очередного раунда переговоров между Россией и США в Эр-Рияде. Проект соглашения подразумевает не только полную свободу судоходства в акватории Черного моря, но и снятие целого ряда санкций с России. В чем смысл этих договоренностей и почему администрация Дональда Трампа заинтересована в их реализации? \r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Одной из несостоявшихся сенсаций прошлой недели было сообщение о том, что российский ЗРК С-400 якобы впервые сбил истребитель F-16 ВВС Украины. Эта новость в итоге не была официально подтверждена, и тем не менее некоторые детали позволяют предположить, что Россия действительно взяла крупный военно-технический рубеж в боевой авиации. О чем идет речь?\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Уже «в скором времени», по словам президента США Дональда Трампа, между Киевом и Вашингтоном будет подписано соглашение по редкоземельным металлам (РЗМ). Намерение заключить аналогичный договор с Украиной декларировалось и Евросоюзом. Однако на самом деле Европа способна найти эти ключевые для современной промышленности элементы гораздо ближе, и Украина для этого вовсе не нужна.\r\n\r\n\t            Подробности\n\n\n\r\n\t            Спецслужбы Украины продолжают организовывать покушения на видных деятелей России. В этот раз ФСБ удалось предотвратить теракт в отношении митрополита Симферопольского и Крымского Тихона. Эксперты отмечают, что для украинских властей расправы над христианским духовенством стали нормой, а вице-премьер Сербии Александр Вулин назвал покушение атакой на весь православный мир. Какую цель преследовал Киев, планируя это преступление?\r\n\t            Подробности\n\nУкраинская пропаганда прошла путь от тезиса о победе над Россией до необходимости объяснения того, почему большая часть национальных богатств скоро будет в руках американцев.\nПротивостоять неизменной стратегии «разделяй и властвуй» со стороны США и Европы можно только объединяя усилия России и Китая для решения внутренних проблем развития Евразии.\nПо старой украинской традиции, свержение президентов начинается с бунта олигархов. Так было с Януковичем, который начал отжимать активы старых друзей, так было и с Порошенко, который вступил в жесткий конфликт с Коломойским и рядом других крупных бизнесменов. Так, вероятно, будет и с Зеленским.\nВ Германии нашли новое место работы для одиозного министра иностранных дел Анналены Бербок, которая скоро покинет свой пост. Но это место работы, к сожалению, не в Германии.\nРуководство Армении пытается одновременно восстановить отношения с Россией и начать вступление в Евросоюз. Второе неудивительно, а вот первое для Пашиняна странно.

Introduced last May, AI Overviews is a feature that displays a natural language response to the user’s query above standard search results. Google is switching the capability to its newest Gemini 2.0 series of large language models.\nThe company didn’t specify which specific model AI Overviews will use. The most capable Gemini 2.0 algorithm, Gemini 2.0 Pro, supports prompts with up to 2 million tokens. The company says that it can interpret complex queries, generate code and reason using general knowledge better than all its previous LLMs.\nThe Gemini 2.0 series also includes the efficiency-optimized 2.0 Flash-Lite model. It costs the same as a midrange LLM Google debuted last May, but provides better response quality across most of the benchmarks evaluated by the company.\nInitially, AI Overviews will leverage Gemini 2.0 to generate responses for U.S. users when they enter coding or advanced math questions. The model series will also be activated in response to multimodal queries. Compared with the previous version, the upgraded edition of AI Overviews is expected to generate more accurate output. \n“With Gemini 2.0’s advanced capabilities, we provide faster and higher quality responses and show AI Overviews more often for these types of queries,” Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google Search, detailed in a blog post.\nGoogle detailed the upgrades alongside AI Mode, an even more capable version of AI Overviews designed to answer complex queries. It’s available through the company’s Search Labs beta testing program. Initially, the feature is only accessible to users of Google One AI Premium, a subscription that provides access to more AI capabilities than a standard Google account.\nAI Mode is powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.0. According to the company, it processes prompts with a method dubbed query fan-out that involves running multiple searches and then combining the results into a single answer. An AI Mode response can include up to multiple paragraphs.\nThe feature’s prompt answers incorporate information from not only webpages but also Google’s Knowledge Graph system. It’s a repository of factual knowledge such as sports scores, stock prices and weather forecasts. The dataset is rounded out by information about billions of products that AI Mode can use to answer shopping-related queries.\nDuring the initial testing phase, Google will collect user feedback to improve the feature’s output accuracy and interface. It plans to follow up the initial enhancements with a set of more extensive upgrades. “We’re already working on new capabilities and updates, like adding more visual responses with images and video, richer formatting, new ways to get to helpful web content and much more,” Stein said.\nStrike raises $13.5M to expand its AI-driven continuous penetration testing platform\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nStrike raises $13.5M to expand its AI-driven continuous penetration testing platform\nSECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 2 HOURS AGO\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 4 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 7 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 8 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 10 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 10 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

            "full_content": "UPDATED 15:47 EDT / MARCH 18 2025\n\n\n\n\t                    \t\t                        by \nMaria Deutscher\n\n\nConfirming recent rumors, Google LLC today announced plans to acquire Wiz Inc. for $32 billion.\nThe all-cash transaction values the cybersecurity startup $20 billion higher than what it was worth following its most recent funding round. The sum is also a significant premium to the $23 billion that Google reportedly offered for Wiz last year. According to TechCrunch, the cybersecurity provider walked away from the latter deal and told employees it would seek to go public instead.\nReuters reported today that Google has agreed to pay Wiz a $3.2 billion termination fee if the deal falls through. This clause might be a hedge against regulatory challenges. According to CNBC, Wiz’s decision to reject Google’s $23 billion bid last year was partly motivated by concerns antitrust regulators might block the transaction. The acquisition agreement reportedly specifies that Wiz can continue operating independently in the event of protracted antitrust litigation.\nWiz launched in 2020, saw its annualized recurring revenue top $100 million two years later and reportedly reached $700 million not long ago. The company says that more than half the Fortune 100 use its namesake cybersecurity platform. The software helps companies fix vulnerabilities in their cloud environments, secure developers’ code and fend off cyberattacks.\nThe first component of Wiz’s platform is a product called Wiz Cloud. It can spot vulnerabilities such as misconfigured instances, known software exploits and weak access controls. Wiz Cloud is agentless, which means using it doesn’t require administrators to deploy data collection programs in their cloud environments. That significantly speeds up the setup process.\nWiz Defend, the company’s second product, detects and blocks cyberattacks using an eBPF runtime sensor. This is a specialized program embedded directly in the Linux kernel, the part of the operating system that stores its most important components. The Linux kernel has extensive visibility into the cloud applications it powers, which allows Wiz’s eBPF sensor to collect highly detailed data about cybersecurity events.\nWiz Defend also collects data about potential breaches from other sources. With the help of a built-in graph database, it generates a simulation of cloud environments that can be used to study the potential impact of breaches. Wiz Defend also sifts through audit logs for signs of malicious activity. \nThe third component of the company’s product portfolio is Wiz Code. It can highlight software vulnerabilities directly in a developer’s code editor and suggest fixes. The software also spots related issues, such as configuration flaws in the CI/CD pipeline that deploys developers’ code to production.\nWiz is available across all the major public clouds. Google stated today that it has no plans to change that following the acquisition.\nIn a blog post, Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian stated that Wiz will remain compatible with competing clouds after the deal closes. “In addition, we are committed to continuing to support packaged applications, SaaS applications, and those running on virtual and on-premises environments,” he wrote. Google Cloud Marketplace, meanwhile, will continue offering cybersecurity tools from third-party providers.\nKurian detailed that the search giant plans to develop a “unified security platform” by combining Wiz’s technology with its Google Security Operations product. The latter offering, which debuted last year, allows administrators to collect cybersecurity data from multiple sources and analyze it for breach indicators. The software also automates some of the work involved in responding to cyberattacks.\nWiz is not Google’s first multibillion-dollar cybersecurity acquisition. In 2022, the company spent $5.4 billion to acquire Mandiant, a major provider of cybersecurity services. Mandiant helped develop some of the automation capabilities in Google Security Operations, the product with which the search giant plans to combine Wiz.\nGoogle was already influential in the cybersecurity market prior to the Mandiant deal. \nAbout a decade ago, the company’s internal BeyondCorp project helped jumpstart adoption of zero trust security. This is a now-widespread best practice designed to protect technology infrastructure from cyberattacks. It specifies that users and devices must be verified before accessing a sensitive asset even if they’re already logged into the corporate network.\nGoogle has also made other contributions to the cybersecurity community. About a year before buying Mandiant, it released a software security framework called SLSA. It’s designed to help developers protect their code from tempering and other threats.\nGoogle expects to close the Wiz acquisition in 2026 pending regulatory approvals. \nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 7 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?

            "full_content": "By \n\n\tJacqueline Sweet\n\n\n\tSince Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) swept into Washington last month, an anonymous X account called DataRepublican has taken the government demolition crew’s supporters by storm. \n\n\tThe account, and its alleged findings of mismanaged government agency spending, has been shared by Musk often, as well as Utah Senator Mike Lee. The account is followed by Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\n\tThe woman behind the account, who’s described herself as a Deaf software engineer, has appeared anonymously on NewsNation, and on several right-wing programs this month, like Glenn Beck’s Blaze Media show, wearing sunglasses and a hooded sweatshirt to obscure her identity, even as she’s billed as a government spending expert. \n\n\tThe account accused neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol of being a “deep state agent,” asserting his nonprofit, the Defending Democracy Together, is an “indirect beneficiary of USAID,” the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government agency that Musk moved to shutter. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe argument here was, in effect, that USAID gave money to a nonprofit donor-advised fund that gave some money to another nonprofit that then gave some money to Kristol’s organization — so he’s then benefiting from USAID spending. Donations can’t be traced this way, and this basic misunderstanding of how donor-advised funds work led several pundits to analyze DataRepublican’s claims, with one dubbing it the new “Twitter Files.”\n\n\tBut DataRepublican’s fans think her work is genius. Nicole Shanahan, who was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 2024 vice presidential nominee and financier, recently interviewed DataRepublican on her show, telling her: “While you are not necessarily in this administration, what you have done is extraordinary.” \n\n\tConservative host Steve Deace called her a “genius software engineer,” adding “we want to keep her personal identity secure so she is free from corporate media types who would love to do something to intimidate her.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEditor’s picks\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSo who is this government information data guru? \n\n\tThe woman behind the account shared her full name Tuesday evening, after a man on Facebook posted that he knew her from the Deaf community, prompting DataRepublican to confirm her identity as Jennica Pounds.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPounds is indeed a Deaf, female software engineer from Utah, who until this week worked as a senior software engineer at an AI lending company called Upstart, a company that has tangled with regulations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for years. \n\n\tPounds wrote on Tuesday, “I recently resigned from my job to pursue DOGE-adjacent efforts full-time.” \n\n\tBut versions of Pounds’ LinkedIn viewed by Rolling Stone as recently as late last week showed she listed herself as a current employee of Upstart. Some time this week, the LinkedIn was edited to show a February end to her Upstart tenure.\n\n\tEarlier this month, Musk famously tweeted “CFPB RIP” as DOGE moved to gut the agency and the administration paused its work\n\n\tReplying to Musk’s post, DataRepublican tagged Senator Elizabeth Warren (the CFPB was Warren’s brainchild), writing: “Hey @ewarren look at this.”\n\n\tMusk has quoted DataRepublican on X at least 24 times over the last three weeks, telling people to follow the account, and replying “noted” to her claim on Jan. 21 that she found “a quick billion” of federal spending for DOGE to cut. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Content\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrump’s SEC Nominee Consulted for Wall Street, Big Oil, Crypto Interests\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrump Team's War Plans Group Chat Triggers Avalanche of Memes\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRepublicans Are Trying (and Failing) to Defend Reckless War-Plans Group Chat\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFormer Social Security Chief Courts Florida Seniors Enraged by Musk’s Cuts\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHer suggested cuts were funds going to groups like Global Refuge, a faith-based organization that provides safety and support services to immigrants, migrant refugees and asylum-seekers around the world. Two weeks later, Musk declared at 3:14 a.m. on a Sunday that DOGE was “rapidly shutting down” supposedly “illegal payments” to Global Refuge.\n\n\tA newly-launched corresponding website DataRepublican.com lets users search for charities and nonprofit officers. A false claim that Jeffrey Epstein was paid by USAID appears to have started with people using the website and mixing up the notorious sex offender with another Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\tOn Friday, DataRepublican announced she’s adding an ActBlue donor search element to the website, which Musk then amplified, quoting her tweet and saying “interesting.”\n\n\tAt Upstart, Pounds was a Senior Distinguished Machine Learning Engineer since 2023, a high-level position at the publicly-traded San Mateo, California-based company, where she works remotely.\n\n\tA software engineer who has knowledge of the company told Rolling Stone that Pounds’ position was one of the highest levels an engineer could reach there.\n\n\tUpstart received Series A funding and additional later funding from the far-right billionaire Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and co-founder Paul Gu was a Thiel Fellow before launching Upstart in 2012. Thiel, of course, merged PayPal with a Musk-led payment company. \n\n\tUpstart has a complicated relationship with CFPB regulations. The company received a special designation from the CFPB in 2017, during Trump’s first administration, allowing it special regulatory treatment by immunizing the lender from being charged with fair lending law violations with respect to its underwriting algorithm. \n\n\tUpstart was the first company to receive such a letter. The no-action status was renewed in November 2020, and the company then immediately closed its first public offering and began trading on Nasdaq.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIn February 2020, Sens. Warren and Cory Booker, and then-Sens. Kamala Harris and Robert Menendez, wrote to the company, expressing concern about the company’s adherence to fair lending laws and asking for insight into how the company made credit determinations.\n\n\tBut in 2022, the company asked for its no-action status to be terminated, the bureau wrote, rather than have the CFPB review “significant changes to its artificial intelligence model,” as the CFPB required, “effectively ending the company’s special regulatory status, and allowing it to be able to make changes to its model without need for CFPB review and approval.”\n\n\tPounds’ job at Upstart involved working on that AI model, two sources say, although she started with Upstart a year later, in May 2023.\n\n\tUpstart’s CEO and cofounder Dave Girouard participated in the U.S. Senate AI Insight Forum in November 2023, telling senators that his AI lending company is an example of AI working well without added legislation.\n\n\t“In 2012, before even launching the company, we naively marched up to the San Francisco office of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and introduced ourselves,” he stated. “This was not one of the new ‘Offices of Innovation’ — this was the local enforcement team. But what did we know? We were convinced that we were the good guys and were committed to innovating within the law.” \n\n\tLater that month, Upstart was subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding disclosures related to use of its artificial intelligence models and loans, according to the company’s quarterly report. \n\n\tBefore co-founding Upstart, Girouard was President of Enterprise at Google. \n\n\tHe posted on X in December about the CFPB looking to AI for a new lending model, joking, “Hath hell frozen over?” \n\n\t“It costs NYC 8-12X more than EUROPEAN cities to build a mile of subway! We need DOGE for every state and city gov.,” he posted in January.\n\n\tIn a statement to Rolling Stone, Pounds wrote: “My former employer has nothing to do with my activities. Leave them out of it.”\n\n\tGirouard and Gu did not immediately reply to comment.\n\n\tBefore becoming DOGE’s favorite anonymous expert, Pounds ran a Github that analyzed election data in Florida and North Carolina, two states she has lived in. Prior to her role at Upstart, Pounds worked at Snap Inc., eBay and Amazon.\n\n\tPounds and her husband, who worked for a decade at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also own a distillery in Salt Lake City. \n\n\tPounds registered a Utah company called Redata, LLC in 2020.

            "full_content": "UPDATED 19:13 EDT / MARCH 11 2025\n\n\n\n\t                    \t\t                        by \nDuncan Riley\n\n\nGoogle LLC is reportedly in final talks to acquire AdHawk Microsystems Inc., a maker of eye-tracking technology, for $115 million.\nAccording to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who references “people who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn’t been announced,” Google is looking to make the acquisition as part of a renewed push into headsets and smart glasses. The reported $115 million acquisition price on the table would include a $15 million payout based on AdHawk reaching certain performance targets, which is not an unusual clause in some tech acquisition deals.\nGurman’s source says the agreement is on track to be completed this week, but it’s still possible that the talks could fall apart since the deal hasn’t been signed off as yet. Neither Google nor AdHawk have commented on the report so far.\nFounded in 2017, AdHawk Microsystems specializes in developing advanced eye-tracking technology that bridges the connection between the eyes and the brain. The company’s proprietary micro-electromechanical systems eye tracker eliminates the need for traditional cameras, enabling higher sampling rates, lower latency and improved efficiency.\nAdHawk’s technology supports wireless tracking at 250 Hertz and tethered tracking at 500 Hertz, with less than four milliseconds latency and approximately one-degree error. The capabilities make the eye-tracking system highly efficient for integration into consumer electronics, including smart glasses and metaverse applications, the sort of things that Google may be interested in.\nThe company takes a full-stack approach, covering everything from custom silicon design to cloud-based analytics. The AdHawk chip design team produces specialized CMOS-MEMS devices at a wafer scale, meeting rigorous consumer electronics standards with the help of a global supply chain.\nAdHawk has developed infrastructure such as anthropomorphic robots and turnkey integration workflows to help with integration into original equipment manufacturer products. The company has also previously manufactured and distributed MindLink glasses for researchers and clinicians; the company can produce smart glasses and similar products in-house, another appealing aspect for Google.\nComing into its potential acquisition, AdHawk has raised $22.3 million in funding over multiple rounds. Investors in the company include Intel Capital Corp., Samsung Venture Investment Corp., Sony Innovation Fund, Brightspark Ventures Inc., Ripple Ventures Management Inc., HP Tech Ventures, Groupe Roski S.A., EssilorLuxottica Société Anonyme, Canso Investment Counsel Ltd. and Ride Home Fund.\nGoogle’s interest in AdHawk comes after it debuted Android XR, a new operating system for virtual reality and augmented devices, in December. Further indicating a renewed interest in virtual and augmented reality headsets, Google announced in January that it was acquiring parts of HTC Corp. Vive’s engineering team to accelerate the development of its new Android XR operating system for virtual reality and extended reality headsets.\nThough Google has been down the headset path before with its Google Glass products, which were sold between 2013 and 2023 but never found more than a niche audience, the company’s renewed interest in AR, VR and mixed reality glasses may not be primarily about the technology itself, but what they can build into it.\nLike Android before, Android XR is another platform to embed Google products. Notable when the HTC deal was announced in January was that the devices will “ship with the company’s flagship Gemini AI model.” The new race for smart glasses may not be so much about the user experience with visuals than another path in the race to gain market share and users in the artificial intelligence race.\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nZoom embraces agentic AI with dozens of new innovations\nAI - BY ZEUS KERRAVALA . 2 HOURS AGO\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot gets AI reasoning skills for advanced research and analysis\nAI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 5 HOURS AGO\nNSA warned about vulnerabilities in Signal prior to White House group chat fiasco\nPOLICY - BY JAMES FARRELL . 6 HOURS AGO\nOpenAI upgrades ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities\nAI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 7 HOURS AGO\nCerebras Systems faces delays in IPO as CFIUS review remains unresolved\nINFRA - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 8 HOURS AGO\nApple to host WWDC 2025 June 9-13, with OS upgrades expected\nAPPS - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 9 HOURS AGO\nLike Free Content?
