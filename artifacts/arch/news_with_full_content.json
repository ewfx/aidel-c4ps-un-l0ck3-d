The service still has big competition with YouTube, which has dominated Nielsen’s list of the most-watched streaming services for the past two years. Neumann said Netflix wants to tackle the part of the streaming market that “neither of us are capturing,” such as traditional TV, Variety reports.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Invest in companies with products so good that they can raise their prices at will.\nThat's the thinking behind a list of stocks Morgan Stanley published in a client note on Monday.\nThe bank's top equity strategist, Mike Wilson, had his team of analysts put together a list of companies that they think are most protected from tariffs compared to other firms in their respective industries, perhaps because they can pass along the higher import costs to consumers.\nThe note came amid news that President Donald Trump's trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China is back in full force — for now, at least.\nStocks fell on Tuesday on the news as investors worried about the ramifications for inflation, interest rates, and corporate earnings.\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has hinted that the 25% tariffs imposed on America's two neighbors and the 20% import fees on Chinese goods could be reduced soon, it remains unclear to what degree they could come down and for how long. New tariffs on goods from European Union countries are also expected at some point.\nBelow are the 18 stocks on the list that Morgan Stanley also has an \"Overweight\" rating on, meaning the bank thinks investors might do well to hold the stock in their portfolios above its weight in the S&P 500.

            "full_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman showed up to Morgan Stanley's tech conference last week. The event was closed to the public and the media, so details have been thin about what was discussed. Until now.\nOn Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts published a roundup of comments from the event, including some of what Altman and OpenAI discussed.\nThis company is one of the world's most valuable startups, working on AI technology that could revolutionize business and broader society. And Altman is probably the second most famous tech executive in the world, behind Elon Musk.\nThis makes it pretty important to check up on Altman's thinking regularly — especially when he shares thoughts in a semi-private setting.\nHere are some highlights from the event, according to Morgan Stanley analysts:\nAltman spoke about how AI could be deflationary. He said that this is one of the impacts of this technology that is most underappreciated and misunderstood by investors.\n\"This potential deflationary impact is consistent with our Thematic work where we have highlighted the potential for higher global efficiency and productivity… which would help offset inflation,\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote.\nThe cost to access and use generative AI models has been collapsing. This is partly due to new techniques that have made creating top AI models easier. I wrote last year that there are tons of great models, so the laws of supply and demand dictate that they are becoming more of a commodity, and hence cheaper.\nThis is likely great news for developers and businesses that need to access these AI models because they are paying a lot less than a year ago.\nOpenAI highlighted significant capacity constraints, saying that its large fleet of graphic processing units is \"completely saturated.\" This is true both in the training stage, where AI models are created, and in the inference stage, which runs these models.\nOpenAI also said that it has never experienced a situation \"where it can't sell out access to its GPUs at reasonable margins.\"\n\"At a high level these comments are consistent with our thematic framework where a small number of leading companies (or individuals) are focused on training/building the leading LLM…which will require significant compute,\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote, referring to large language models.\nThere's been some hand-wringing lately about how strong GPU demand may be in the future, so OpenAI's comments are notable.\nIn contrast, OpenAI isn't worried about the supply of data to train its models.\nThe startup highlighted its ability to use its GPUs and existing AI models to create more data. This is known as synthetic data, and it's becoming increasingly useful for certain stages of the model-creation process.\n\"Data is not a constraint in the way that compute is a constraint (or even the way energy may one day be),\" Morgan Stanley's analysts wrote.\nOpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.\nDo you have a story to share about AI?

Figure out where you're vulnerable and \"fortify\" against it before you're in crisis mode.\nDeeply embedded in Morgan Stanley during the recession, Porat said her experiences at the investment bank provided her with a playbook for hard times.\n\"There were a lot of really important lessons that came out of it, and when I got to Google, I was asked about them — which struck me as a bit odd, because Google had only seen sunny days,\" Porat said during an \"In Good Company\" podcast interview. \"And I think, really importantly, the lessons are good for good times and bad.\"\nPorat began her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987, spending 22 years in its investment banking division before serving as the bank's CFO from 2010 to 2015.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Porat said she helped advise the US Treasury through the bailouts of insurance giant AIG and mortgage-financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nAs fears of a possible recession loom large on Wall Street, advice from those who've weathered them in the past may prove increasingly relevant today. Some of Porat's recommendations are applicable to the individual — not just the multinational conglomerate.\n\"The most important lesson from the crisis is to identify your greatest source of vulnerability ahead of time and protect against it,\" she said.\nFor businesses navigating the financial crisis, that weakness in question was liquidity, according to Porat.\n\"I think a really important lesson for everyone is to do that question — what is your greatest source of vulnerability?\" she said. \"You can protect against it early on, but not in the moment.\"\nIn the case of institutions — Porat said it's best to load up on talent with the ability to take a broad view of things.\n\"Make sure you have a team with horizontal vision, because you've got to connect the dots across a lot of different issues,\" she said.\nAnd perhaps most crucially — there's no easy way out of a brutal situation, Porat said. It's best to just grit one's teeth and triage your way through it.\n\"I think the other really important lesson was that there are no good choices in a crisis,\" Porat said. \"And so go for the least worst and just keep moving, because standing still can actually just amplify, magnify — and you're not going to end up with a good solution in any event. By definition, you're in a crisis.\"\nAfterward her time at Morgan Stanley, Porat transitioned into the same role at Google. Today, she serves as president and chief investment officer at the search giant and its parent company, Alphabet."

Even if they buy 100% of the power it generates, because of the way the wholesale electricity market works you and me would be subsidizing the profits of a trillion-dollar multinational corporation through our u \nAs I keep saying... market failure.\nOk, cool cool.We'll pay for the refining and disposal, they can reap the electricity.No. No we won't.\nThis is a reaction to the new US government. They are hoping for some free taxpayer money.\nExactly. They are hoping to get a lot of taxpayer money by way of excessively expensive generated nuclear power being sold to them for cheap. The current political climate of grandstanding, incompetence, disconnect, old and obsolete ideas and hiding the real cost makes that move look good. If you have no morals or integrity. Obviously, big-tech is not restricted by those.\nThey are probably also hoping that Elonias current destruction of the federal government will degrade decision making processes enough for \nSounds about par for the course.\nTo be fair, they don't really care if it's taxpayer money or some other commercial entity's money.\nThey just really want it to be someone else's money.  That's why they are happy to put out a joint press release asking for *someone* to build a shitload of nuclear power, but don't dare look in their direction regardless of trillion dollar valuations.\nIndeed. But what they really want here is energy for cheap that is the most expensive to generate. They are trying to capitalize from the revitalized stupidity that nuclear power is somehow a good idea or worth the cost. And hence there would be a huge bill for the taxpayer.\nTypical corporate assholes that only know how to take, take, take. And obviously they will not finance any of this themselves, because they know it would be a really bad investment into an obsolete technology.\nNuclear power is the most expensive to generate?  Do you have a source for that?  I can take a quick look at Wikipedia and see that nuclear power costs less than solar, with possible exception of large scale fixed axis PV. You need to learn to read. Or maybe to lie less. (Yes, I know lying is your thing, but hey, I can hope...)\nNuclear power is the most expensive to generate?  Do you have a source for that?

That may work on the internet but in the real world that isn't going to fly.\nDid you even look at the chart you linked?  Or are you just hoping nobody would click on it and immediately see that you're wrong?\nThe low prices for nuclear in your source are for EXISTING nuclear.  Obviously we can't expand EXISTING generation without uprating, and if they could uprate existing reactors they already would have.\nWe're talking about NEW here.  And when it comes to new, nuclear loses to just about everything unless you're looking at 10+ year old IPCC (2014) data, which would make you look pret \nIts cheap if you get someone else to pay for the expensive parts.Government's gotta oversee -pay for- refining bc you dont want that hot stuff getting loose.Government's gotta take care of disposal bc the businesses that were using all that cheap ! electricity all went out of business.\nLet's allow them to do so first.\nWorking families shouldn't have to compete with AI for scarce electricity in an infrastructure that humans built.\nThere is local legislation for Small Nuclear Reactors here now, where they want us to pay for them so they can build data centers here.\nI saw an article about this earlier this morning, which also said that the only functional ones in the world are in China and Russia.  So they want us to be guinea pigs too.\nSo pay for it.Yep.  Non-binding support means that they want more electricity at low prices and they support someone else doing whatever is needed to give them that cheap electricity.\nYep.  Non-binding support means that they want more electricity at low prices and they support someone else doing whatever is needed to give them that cheap electricity.\nAll of this time we've been told to conserve power, go green, etc.  Now all of that conservation is just going down the drain of AI, bitcoin farms and data centers.  How about THEY start cutting back?\nNaaa, why should they? They are not the ones trying to do anything about climate change or the widening wealth-gap.\nYou're profoundly stupid.\n  Is the Sun causing global warming? [nasa.gov] \n One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the Sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of solar energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites, which tell us that there has been no upward trend in the amount of solar energy reaching our planet. \n A second smoking gun is that if the Sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all lay\nAll of this time we've been told to conserve power, go green, etc. Now all of that conservation is just going down the drain of AI, bitcoin farms and data centers.

It's just more corporate welfare. If they can't support human welfare, we shouldn't support their corporate welfare.\nSo fuck that shit, they've done it enough. \n\nA quick look at OurWorldInData [ourworldindata.org] indicates that total capacity has gone from ~2,540 TWh in 2000 to ~2,700 in the 2020-2023 window (jagged but roughly flat).   So, about a 6.3% increase over the last 25 years, globally.    Now, in the next 25 years, they want to see a 300% increase, in deployment of systems that take on the order of 6-8 years each, globally (thanks Google).  With a little over 400 plants operating (per Google, 2023) globally, that means a net build of ~1200 equivalent plants, not accounting for rebuilds or decomissionings.   Then further, all those reactors need the associated transmission capability and grid capacity, wheresoever they may be built.\n\n\nAll of this build needs to involve fairly rare, specialized skill sets and fabrication capabilities, which would need to be expanded to handle the volume (and then, perhaps, be mothballed? Or would the pace continue afterwards?) -- and over 25 years, we're talking about people who are starting *today* being potentially ready for retirement at completion, so entire generations of skilled workforce being involved.\n\n\nCan it be done? Potentially.  Personnel,manufacturing, and materials availability becomes a concern, but those might be worked through.    Realistically?  Not even close.\nThe bigger concern is red tape.  Regulation should be in place, but it should not be so time consuming as to delay building by years after the plans and applications are in place.\nYes, there were delays due to bad engineering and/or execution.  But permitting took 4 years.  I suppose \"timely fashion\" is a subjective term.\nhttps://www.nrc.gov/reactors/n... [nrc.gov]\nIt's not. Regulation isn't a holdup for nuclear power. Actual construction capabilities are. You can see that in places like China where even without regulations in a country where life is cheap it takes a long time for nuclear to be built. Procuring capability in this industry takes about as long as it does from putting a shovel to the ground to being finished.\nCan it be done? Potentially.  Personnel,manufacturing, and materials availability becomes a concern, but those might be worked through.    Realistically?

In the 1970s the USA was able to put one gigawatt of new nuclear power generating capacity on the grid every month on average.  25 years, 12 months in a year, 300 GW.  We have about 100 GW of nuclear power capacity in the USA currently so the math checks out.  Well, it takes about 7 or 8 years to complete a new nuclear power project so that's 300 GW in 30 to 40 years if we start now and do not exceed the pace set around about 1975, but our economy and construction capacity has increased since then.Tripling\nTriple capacity in the next 25 years?

            "full_content": "The law’s 26 words were written to address the same challenges we face today.\nThe law’s 26 words were written to address the same challenges we face today.\nRon Wyden has represented Oregon in the US Senate since 1996 and is the co-author of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\nAcross U.S. politics, it’s become fashionable to blame nearly all the internet’s ills on one law I co-wrote: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Everyone from President Donald Trump to some of my Democratic colleagues argue that Section 230 has let major tech platforms moderate too much or too little. Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, has already written about his plans to reinterpret the law himself.\nMany of these claims give Section 230 too much credit. While it’s a cornerstone of internet speech, it’s a lesser support compared to the First Amendment, as well as Americans’ own choices in what they want to see online. But I’m convinced the law is just as necessary today as when I co-wrote it with Rep. Chris Cox in 1996.\nTrump attacked Section 230 in his first stint as president. In his second, his administration is already using its power to pressure TV stations, newspapers, and social media companies to bow to his will. Major tech platforms with deep-pocketed legal teams seem happy to accommodate Trump and other government censors, as long as they’re allowed to keep raking in billions by selling targeted ads and scooping up Americans’ private information. And without Section 230, potential competitors will stand little chance of getting off the ground.\nJust look at Bluesky, which has gained millions of users in only a few months as people flee X. Without Section 230, anyone aggrieved by a decision from Bluesky’s nascent moderation team could initiate a devastating lawsuit on any number of claims, smothering it in legal fees even if it won. The next upstart may never launch at all — leaving users with no alternatives to the government-favored Big Tech cartel.\nCritics of Section 230 often charge that the internet has fundamentally changed in the past three decades. Yet the bill’s 26 key words were written to address the same challenges we face today: keeping kids safe online, leveling the playing field between entrenched corporate interests and small innovators, and ensuring that individuals — not the government — control what we see online.\nHere’s how they came to be.\n In 1995, Chris Cox and I had a standing weekly lunch in a small space near the official House dining room. Nobody batted an eye at a conservative House member from Orange County, California and a liberal Congressman from Portland, Oregon hashing out ideas back then… except, maybe, when someone wandered by and heard us talking about the internet. \nIt’s hard to overemphasize how strange the Internet was in 1995. Only about 20 million people in the U.S. had access to it. There were only some 100,000 websites (today, there are more than 2 billion) and today’s most popular Internet destinations did not exist.\nTo both of us, the internet looked like a lifeline for our districts. Oregon’s economy was booming with a vital forest products sector, but I knew my state needed to attract new industries. Chris’s district had been a center of the aerospace industry for decades, but the end of the Cold War had battered the sectory. The Internet was “one of the hottest new markets to develop in years,” according to Morgan Stanley — a line that hastened the heartbeats of two young Congressmen who wanted good, new jobs in their districts.\nCongress was in the midst of a much-needed overhaul to the Communications Act of 1934, which regulated the telephone industry and broadcast spectrum. Most legislators embraced this as an opportunity to eliminate stifling regulatory constraints. But where some of us saw economic growth in the internet, others saw something else: pornography.\nAs the new communications law was being debated in 1995, a censorious senior member of the U.S. Senate, James Exon from Nebraska, read a prayer into the Congressional Record that asked “Almighty God” for “the wisdom to create regulations” aimed at “controlling the pollution of computer communications.” \nExon proposed a separate bill to ban “obscene, indecent, and destructive” content from the Internet. Called the Communications Decency Act, it intended to prevent anyone under the age of 18 from encountering “any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.” Not only would the writers and producers and posters of such indecencies face fines or jail, so would websites and internet service providers that allowed access.\nThe CDA would have strangled the internet in its cradle. Exon figured if the government had used FCC licensing and the so-called fairness doctrine to regulate broadcast speech for decades, regulating internet speech should work as well. But there were some 15,000 radio stations and 1,700 TV stations in the U.S. at the time, and only a handful of national networks. On the internet, as Chris wrote in a later retrospective, “the number of content creators—each a ‘broadcaster,’ as it were—was the same as the number of users. It would soon expand from hundreds of millions to billions.”\nEven back then, Chris and I both understood that it was physically impossible for the government, the service providers, or the platforms to pre-screen the avalanche of internet content for anything “indecent.” Exon’s proposal was a recipe for vast, new, intrusive, and ultimately ineffective government bureaucracies. \nWhat’s more, a pair of recent legal decisions had created a worrying precedent. They effectively punished internet portals — the closest thing to Facebook or TikTok — for trying to remove the exact kind of “indecent” content Exon and other lawmakers feared.\nThat didn’t matter to the U.S. Senate, where fewer than half the Senators then had email. Exon’s bill passed 84–16. Our colleagues in the House weren’t much better—barely a quarter had email - and we were pretty sure they were going to support the proposal. Who wanted to appear weak on porn?\nWe needed an idea that threaded a lot of needles. It needed to be big, but simple. It needed to appeal not just to both political parties, but to conservative and liberal factions within each party. \nThe idea I offered to Chris was to create a liability shield that blended conservative and liberal concepts. From Republican orthodoxy, we would write a law that sidestepped Big Government and be 100 percent tilted in favor of parental control over children’s Internet consumption. From the liberal Democrat side, our law would block Government censorship of speech and be uncompromisingly pro-user privacy.\nWe captured these elements in the name we attached to our bill: the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act.\nSome critics of Section 230 claim it’s granted special rights to internet platforms. Yet at its heart our proposal simply applied four long-standing principles and rights to the internet.\nFirst, a distributor is not a publisher. My wife Nancy Bass Wyden is the third-generation owner of the fabled New York bookstore the Strand. The Strand offers 2.5 million book titles over 18 miles of shelves, but it isn’t the publisher of a single one of them. Chris and I wanted to clarify that the same relationship existed between websites and individual creators who posted there.\nSecond, distribution of content is as protected as the creation of content. Governments not only have no authority to ban a publisher from printing a book, they have no authority to prevent a bookstore from carrying it. Chris Cox and I considered that a perfect analogy to the peril facing online sites that accepted user postings, and we wanted to make it clear that Internet content creators and their distributors had the same protections as people working in print or radio or film.\nThird, distributors have the right to determine what content they will carry or not carry, as well as the conditions in which they carry or promote content, and that those decisions do not make them publishers. \nFourth, only the actual speaker, writer, or publisher of content is accountable for that content. Can people be libeled or defamed on the Internet? Absolutely. Can innocent parties be injured by misinformation, disinformation, or careless errors? No question. Can the legal system provide recourse? You bet: the same recourse available to people who claim harm from content in other media.\nChris Cox’s and my main goal was to give the Internet the same underlying principles of both freedom and responsibility that other media had. Best of all (we thought then, and I still think it now) we rendered these principles in the simplest way we could—with 26 carefully chosen words:\n“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by an information content provider.”\nInternet pornographers who illegally targeted kids, or people who defamed and harassed others, were still subject to every hammer the law could bring down on them. But that hammer wouldn’t pound the Internet platforms and service providers.\nWe made it very clear to members of the House that they faced a choice: They could empower parents to filter the content that their kids could access, or they could set up a Big Brother–style censorship program with thousands of Government employees using hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to screen and approve every piece of content before it made its way onto the World Wide Web.\nOur bill’s fate was an anti-climax — but a welcome one. It passed the House 420–4. A few months later, the Supreme Court unanimously declared most of Exon’s Communications Decency Act unconstitutional. Only our 26-word provision, still called CDA Section 230, survived.\nWhat Chris Cox and I saw in a nation without Section 230 was a media and tech world that would continue to be dominated by the giant gatekeepers who had ruled their industries for the better part of the 20th century—a world where hosting a website would require a legion of lawyers that would become the new barrier to entry that kept the media in the hands of the few. The law Cox and I wrote was an affirmation of the right to publish free speech in this technology-enabled world. \nWe were well aware of the old A. J. Liebling adage, “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.” We wanted to continue to guarantee that freedom in the new world — where everyone owns a press that they carry in their pocket.\nAdapted from It Takes Chutzpah.

The most recent fears for Apple's bottom line appear to be the postponement of Siri upgrades, higher product import costs because of Trump administration tariffs, with both leading to lower earnings per share.\rWhile Woodring remains bullish on what may be a redesigned iPhone 17 driving sales, he's less certain about other avenues of success. He's decreased calendar year 2025 iPhone shipments a bit, with sales in 2025 being flat year-over-year, as opposed to an increase.\rThe analyst appears to be leaning on a survey that they ran, citing \"access to advanced AI features\" as a driver of smartphone sales. We're not certain how accurate this is, given survey biases for surveys like this have historically tended to be toward the higher-end of iPhone sales, versus the larger market that has generally not cared if they have the newest features or not.\rWoodring feels that the upgrade cycle will continue to lengthen given Apple's staggered —  and sometimes delayed —  Apple Intelligence feature roll-out. He does eventually expect a contraction, but not until the 2027-2028 cycle year, and therefore not relevant to Wednesday's price target trim.\rAs far as the impact of tariffs will apply to Apple, that remains fluid.

The upper limit in the short term is $250 —  just short of the new $252 target.\rMorgan Stanley's last price target for Apple stock was set just after earnings, at $275. Woodring said then that iOS 18.4 in April was an \"important catalyst\" looking forward for iPhone sales. \rAt the time, that update was expected to have the upgraded Siri and support for multiple languages, therefore expanding the demand for the iPhone in the newly-supported countries.

Об этом пишет Bloomberg.\nПо данным источника агентства, увольнения коснутся всей компании, в которой работает 80 тысяч человек, за исключением 15 тысяч штатных финансовых консультантов. Предстоящие кадровые решения связывают в том числе с результатами деятельности некоторых пока еще действующих сотрудников, а также влиянием на рабочие процессы искусственного интеллекта (ИИ) и автоматизации.\nФондовый рынок США несет потери на фоне разгорающейся торговой войны администрации Дональда Трампа против основных деловых партнеров страны. Отмечается, что Уолл-стрит переживает серию сокращений (например, они также стоят на повестке у Goldman Sachs), поскольку компании столкнулись с неопределенными экономическими перспективами.\nРанее стало известно, что банки по всему миру приступили к массовым увольнениям сотрудников из-за активного внедрения технологий ИИ. Так, крупнейший в Италии Intesa Sanpaolo, к 2028 году планирует для ускорения цифровизации сократить девять тысяч человек.

            "full_content": "Several weight loss drug stocks are sliding today as pharmaceutical companies battle for dominance in the booming GLP-1 market — which is projected to hit $105 billion by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (MS+0.62%) analysts.\nGLP-1 drugs, also known as incretin treatments, were made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.58%) Ozempic. They mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, fueling unprecedented demand. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY-1.87%) currently dominate the space, but rivals are scrambling to carve out their share.\nSome companies, like Zealand Pharma and Roche (RHHBY+0.66%), are developing next-generation treatments with stronger weight-loss effects. Others, like Hims & Hers (HIMS-1.46%), betted on more affordable off-brand versions — an approach that thrived during shortages of branded medications but now faces stricter regulatory hurdles.\nShares of Zealand Pharma and Roche fell 11% and 2%, respectively, on Thursday morning — just a day after popping on news of their collaboration to develop new weight-loss treatments.\nZealand announced a partnership with Roche to co-develop and commercialize its experimental drug petrelintide, including a potential  combination with Roche’s, CT-388. \nAs part of the deal, Zealand will receive $1.65 billion upfront, with the total package potentially reaching $5.3 billion if development and sales milestones are met. Roche will handle commercial manufacturing and supply.\n“We now hold a more bullish view on the prospect of petrelintide emerging as an important therapeutic intervention for chronic weight management,” William Blair analyst Andy T. Hsieh wrote about the deal in a note Wednesday.\nZealand previously reported that patients taking a high dose of petrelintide over 16 weeks lost an average of 8.6% of their body weight. For comparison, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy led to an average 15% weight loss over 68 weeks in clinical trials.\nRoche, a 127-year-old pharmaceutical giant, made its first major move into the weight-loss drug market in 2024, when it acquired Carmot Therapeutics for $2.7 billion. That deal brought in three obesity drug candidates, including CT-388, which showed promising results in early trials — patients lost 18.8% of their body weight on average after 24 weeks.\nHims & Hers, the telehealth company catering to millennials, saw its stock drop nearly 5% Thursday morning.\nThe company jumped into the GLP-1 market last May, offering compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic. The move paid off as Hims & Hers’ total sales surged 69% last year to $1.5 billion.\nBut now, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that shortages of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound are officially over. With branded medications now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded versions that closely mimic FDA-approved drugs.\nEarlier this week, the FDA clarified its policies, giving companies like Hims & Hers until May 22 to stop selling compounded GLP-1 medications that are essentially identical to commercial versions.\nStill, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "Citi's wealth boss, Andy Sieg, is bringing in a Morgan Stanley technology leader to strengthen the bank's offering in the ultra-competitive race to manage wealth clients' money.\nThe bank has hired Dipendra Malhotra as head of wealth technology, according to a person familiar with the matter. Malhotra is joining Citi in late-May after 11 years at its rival, Morgan Stanley, where he led the bank's AI, machine learning, analytics, and data for its wealth management business.\nImproving technology and digital offerings within Citi's wealth management unit has been a top priority for Sieg, who Citi CEO Jane Fraser tapped in 2023 to turn the wealth unit around. Citibank has struggled with its tech over the years, a problem that has extended to its wealth business. An internal audit conducted by Ernst & Young estimated that it would cost the bank at least $500 million to fix its patchwork of tech systems, Business Insider reported last year.\nStill, it's an area where Sieg is hoping to gain some ground.\nCiti's technology and operating platform \"has been a limiting factor in this business,\" Sieg said at the BofA Securities Financial Services Conference in February. He has confidence that Fraser's transformation initiative, and its focus on data quality, is fortuitous for his business, adding that \"we're setting the stage for us to be able to compete in a very different way to put work\" for both clients and advisors.\nWhile at Morgan Stanley, Malhotra was responsible for developing and maintaining data, AI, and machine learning tech for its wealth business. Morgan Stanley made headlines as one of the first Wall Street firms to partner with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which has afforded its financial advisors with generative AI tools to help lessen drudge work.\nWhen Malhotra joins Citi in a few months, he'll report directly to its chief information officer, Jonathan Lofthouse. Lofthouse became the bank's CIO when he absorbed the co-CIO position held by Shadman Zafar until he departed the bank in February.\nAt Citi, Malhotra is tasked with spearheading the modernization of its wealth technology, according to an internal memo from Lofthouse, seen by BI. He'll be working closely with two relatively new faces at Citi, Eric Lordi, a former JPMorgan executive, who heads up the wealth platform and experience and joined in January, and Joe Bonanno, who was named Citi's head of data, analytics, and innovation in July.\n\"Technology is the backbone of our ability to serve clients today and in the future, especially in an industry that is evolving at an unprecedented pace,\" Lofthouse said in the memo about Malhotra. \"To make sure we are providing the absolute best wealth experiences for our clients, our technology must be nothing short of industry-leading,\""

            "full_content": "With post-election gains in the rear-view mirror, Morgan Stanley’s (MS+0.62%) chief U.S. equity strategist is raising some concerns about the fate of the S&P 500 through at least June. The gist? The Trump bump may morph into a protracted slump.\nMark Wilson said the index could suffer as much as a 5% drop to 5,500 in the first half of 2025 — according to a report cited by Bloomberg — echoing other analysts’ fears regarding the near-term outcomes of tariffs, inflation, and other phenomena that have come to define the early days of President Trump’s second term.\nThe S&P 500 had fallen about 2.3% today as of 12:21 p.m. in New York. Its intraday low so far is 5,637.75 points. Since January 1, it’s slipped about 3.9%.\nWilson thinks the index may recover to 6,500 by year-end, but “the path is likely to be volatile as the market continues to contemplate these growth risks, which could get worse before they get better.” \nYet, the strategist warned a full-blown recession could torpedo the index by 20%, adding: “We are not there, but things can change quickly [....].”\nEven with fomenting concerns, some analysts have recently offered rosier commentary on at least a few powerhouses in tech and retail:\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "Morgan Stanley ha rivisto al ribasso le sue previsioni per il titolo Apple, riducendo il target di prezzo da 275 a 252 dollari. Secondo l'analista Erik Woodring, le difficoltà della società di Cupertino derivano principalmente da due fattori: un rallentamento nel tasso di aggiornamento degli iPhone e l'impatto economico dei nuovi dazi imposti dall'amministrazione Trump.\n\r\nNella sua ultima nota agli investitori, Woodring ha sottolineato come il posticipo del rilascio di Siri potenziato da Apple Intelligence e l'aumento dei costi di importazione stiano incidendo sulle prospettive di crescita della società di Cupertino. Questi elementi, secondo l'analista, potrebbero portare a una riduzione degli utili per azione nel breve periodo.\n\nNonostante il ridimensionamento delle previsioni per il 2025, Woodring mantiene una posizione positiva sulle prospettive a lungo termine di Apple. In particolare, il possibile redesign dell'iPhone 17 potrebbe dare una spinta alle vendite future. Tuttavia, per il 2025 l'analista prevede spedizioni globali di iPhone sostanzialmente piatte rispetto all'anno precedente, in contrasto con le aspettative precedenti che indicavano una crescita.\nA influenzare questa previsione sarebbe un'indagine condotta da Morgan Stanley, che evidenzia come l'accesso a funzionalità avanzate di intelligenza artificiale rappresenti un fattore chiave nelle decisioni d'acquisto degli utenti. Tuttavia, i dati dei sondaggi potrebbero essere parzialmente distorti, poiché tendono a riflettere le preferenze della fascia alta del mercato degli smartphone, più incline agli aggiornamenti frequenti rispetto alla maggioranza degli utenti.\nWoodring ritiene che il ciclo di aggiornamento degli iPhone continuerà ad allungarsi, complici i rilasci dilazionati delle funzioni di Apple Intelligence. Secondo l'analista, una nuova accelerazione delle vendite potrebbe verificarsi solo nel periodo 2027-2028, rendendo il taglio del target di prezzo di oggi una misura prudenziale.\nUn altro elemento di incertezza riguarda l'impatto dei dazi sulle importazioni. Secondo le stime di Woodring, Apple potrebbe subire un incremento dei costi di circa 2 miliardi di dollari a causa delle nuove tariffe. Non è ancora chiaro se l'azienda deciderà di assorbire questi costi o trasferirli ai consumatori con un aumento dei prezzi dei suoi dispositivi.\n\r\nNel breve periodo, Morgan Stanley fissa il range di oscillazione del titolo Apple tra i 200 e i 250 dollari, con il nuovo target di prezzo fermo a 252 dollari. Questo segna un ribasso rispetto alla precedente valutazione di 275 dollari, fissata dopo la pubblicazione degli ultimi risultati finanziari.\nAll'epoca, Woodring aveva individuato nell'aggiornamento iOS 18.4 previsto per aprile (attualmente in beta) un “catalizzatore importante” per le vendite di iPhone, grazie all'integrazione di Siri avanzato e il supporto per nuove lingue, italiano compreso, elemento chiave per l'espansione nei mercati emergenti. Tuttavia, mentre l'aggiornamento software arriverà puntuale, il potenziamento di Siri è stato rinviato, indebolendo l'argomento a favore di un immediato aumento delle vendite.\n\nIn un mondo connesso e globalizzato i dazi sono alquanto deleteri.\nLOracolo è da settimane che vende e monetizza :)\nHa talmente ragione che stan crollando i mercati.\nRendere grande l'America con la Cina come concorrente sarà molto dura, però sui dazi ha ragione, la gente non deve mandare i soldi all'estero.\nQuando la borsa sale alzano il target e quando scende lo abbassano, sono dei geni.\nQuesti target di prezzo sono sempre messi a caso, e a mio avviso dovrebbero essere vietati, sai quanti fanno inside trading.Se avessi dato retta agli analisti avrei perso un sacco di soldi.\nLo dicevano anche di Giorgia... per l'Italia...\nPovero Tim.... sta già pensando a un buon ritiro?\nHanno la scusa, il motivo per essere indietro, calmi tutti. Alla fine il lecchinaggio di cook servirà per salvarsi anche questa volta dalla demen.. credenza popolare\nSecondo me ci sono gli estremi per una class action per \"abuso della credulità popolare\" :-))\n\"Il grande Trump che renderà di nuovo grande l'America\" dicevano...\nApple porta laudio lossless e la latenza ultra-bassa sulle AirPods Max con USB-C\nApple, il primo pieghevole sarà simile al Galaxy Z Fold ma con tecnologia \"Air\"\nApple Watch: problemi al sensore per la pressione e incertezze su SE in plastica\nGoogle Maps, un errore ha fatto sparire la cronologia: dati persi per molti utenti\n2008 - 2025 HDnetwork srl - (parte del gruppo BlazeMedia) - P.IVA 06183350484\nI migliori contenuti realizzati da HDblog, impreziositi da commenti e sintesi inediti, ogni giorno nella tua e-mail."

Apple Intelligence is a feature in development, not a selling point. People will continue to buy iPhones for the reasons they bought the last one they bought.That said, regardless of your “feelings” about Apple Intelligence one way or another, I can assure that nearly EVERY person with access to the writing tools should make more use of at least that aspect of AI.For me, the Genmoji/Image Generator will be the part I use the least, but see that’s the great thing about Apple Intelligence — you can use what proves useful to you, and ignore what isn’t useful to you. Gosh, it’s almost like they designed it to work like that.\n\nI doubt it. Apple Intelligence is a feature in development, not a selling point.

Gosh, it’s almost like they designed it to work like that.\nBy now it's clear that Apple Intelligence (and other AI) isn't really driving smartphone hardware sales. There was no big pop in sales when the Apple Intelligence capable iPhone 16 family debuted. So a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features likely won't impact iPhone sales greatly.At least in early 2025 consumer-facing artificial intelligence (in general, not just Apple's offering) is still essentially alpha software. Even Apple labels Apple Intelligence with a \"Beta\" badge but it's barely that (look at the news headlines summary debacle).Clearly you don't need Apple Intelligence for AI assisted writing tools, the third party AI offerings are perfectly capable of that.It's worth noting that Mac sales aren't really affected by Apple Intelligence either; the macOS implementation trails the iOS implementation.Here are the things that consumers prioritize in smartphones: cameras, display, battery life, and price. It's not rocket science. Not peak download speeds on mmWave 5G networks. Not how many polygons it can paint on the screen, not how many TFlops of calculations, not Geekbench scores.I still believe that AI has great potential in the enterprise market and I know it has been used by some very large corporations over several years now. But a context-aware AI chatbot assistant is still years away based on my experiences with 7-8 chatbots. Those tools have way too many mistakes to make them trustworthy so the user ends up spending a lot more time double or triple checking their output. These chatbots aren't trustworthy. They will make up falsehoods and pass them off as fact without any sense of remorse or hesitation.One piss poor tendency that AI designers have programmed into models is the inability for an AI assistant to understand when a question is beyond its capabilities. Trust is earned and a lot of LLM-powered AI chatbot assistants squander some of that trust every time they hallucinate or shovel out some B.S. as an answer.Sure, the engineers say \"we can fix that\" but what they can't fix is the loss of trust. Some of them are belatedly understanding this and now adding more and more boilerplate to answers saying \"okay, we might be wrong so please double check the answer.\" That's right, consumers are being asked to do debugging for piss poor LLMs. But for some of us, it's already too late. That trust ship sailed months ago.I think a handful of Apple executives are realizing this. Half-assed AI will ultimately be more damaging than a delayed version of something actually useful and trustworthy.My guess is within five years, 75% of these AI companies will have disappeared from the landscape. Some of the technology will likely be absorbed by some of the giants for internal use on proprietary tasks. But a large number of these consumer-facing AI services will be laughable memories.And in five years a lot of AI engineers will be changing careers because they won't get hired by another company. AI will be writing most of the code. The people who get AI right won't want to hire the people who got it wrong. This is a critical time for Apple. They have to figure out if the right person is driving the stagecoach right now.

Apple promoted Apple Intelligence for selling iPhone 16 series! I understand that Apple´s AI approach is challenging and different from regular LLMs as Apple focuses on local based LLM feature (That´s why Apple´s approach is harder and more challenging than any cloud-based LLMs).  But given the size in terms of their market cap., it is still embarassing and ridiculous that they are so slow and they are dummy to release something what they have promised for 16 series. My bet is that Apple will never roll out a personalized Siri with such clunky codes. Apple has shown strange moves recently: Normally, Apple is late, but does better. Apple launches when they are ready.But it is surprising to see that Apple hits the market with half-baked features and new products like Vision Pro (Yes..

Apple promoted Apple Intelligence for selling iPhone 16 series! I understand that Apple´s AI approach is challenging and different from regular LLMs as Apple focuses on local based LLM feature (That´s why Apple´s approach is harder and more challenging than any cloud-based LLMs).  But given the size in terms of their market cap., it is still embarassing and ridiculous that they are so slow and they are dummy to release something what they have promised for 16 series. My bet is that Apple will never roll out a personalized Siri with such clunky codes. Apple has shown strange moves recently: Normally, Apple is late, but does better. Apple launches when they are ready.But it is surprising to see that Apple hits the market with half-baked features and new products like Vision Pro (Yes..

            "full_content": "At xAI, Elon Musk has marshaled a workforce that has ballooned by more than 1,000 employees in less than two years as he goes head-to-head with rivals OpenAI and Google.\nBusiness Insider reviewed the company's internal organizational chart to identify and understand the people near the top of the AI venture as of early this year. The chart, which included names, titles, and other information, features former Tesla and Google engineers, Musk's home office manager, and his son.\nAs CEO, Musk oversees a team of more than 1,200 people. Five employees report directly to the billionaire: xAI founding team members Igor Babuschkin, Ross Nordeen, and Jimmy Ba; longtime Musk aide Jared Birchall; and Daniel Rowland, whose involvement in the company hasn't been previously reported.\nA spokesperson for xAI did not respond to a request for comment.\nMusk, Ba, Rowland, Birchall, Babuschkin, and Nordeen did not respond to a request for comment.\nHere's what we know about Musk's direct reports.\nBa was one of Musk's first hires at xAI. He appeared on a livestream alongside Musk and a handful of other xAI employees when the company unveiled the latest version of Grok in February.\nSeveral of Ba's direct reports joined the company as \"Member of Technical Staff\" within the past few months, including Pawan Bhandarkar and Satvik Ramaprasad, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nMost xAI employees roll up to Ba, including around 900 AI \"tutors,\" the hourly employees who train the company's chatbot, Grok. These workers report to team leads who are overseen by \"human data managers.\" The majority of tutors work remotely, and some work outside the US.\nOutside his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. He's part of the Machine Learning Group, faculty from the computer science department who work on various projects involving artificial intelligence. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under the Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, who has been referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\nRowland joined xAI nearly a year ago and oversees both of xAI's data centers, according to the organizational chart.\nThe company built its Memphis data center — which Musk has said is the largest in the world, and which the company has said houses more than 200,000 GPUs — in 122 days, a fraction of the time it typically takes to build such a facility. The company also has two other facilities in Memphis, including a wastewater treatment plant and a site that was announced in March. Musk has said the company plans to scale the site, which he has nicknamed \"Colossus,\" to 2 million GPUs in the coming year.\nxAI also quietly set up a data center in Atlanta in December that houses about 12,000 GPUs.\nRowland has a team of a few dozen people, including eight direct reports. In January, two of those employees left Tesla's Dojo project, which is focused on building the carmaker's custom supercomputer, to join the data center project, LinkedIn profiles show.\nBrent Mayo, a former SpaceX engineer, also reports to Rowland. Mayo has become the face of xAI in Memphis, where he frequently engages with local officials and serves as the senior manager of site builds and infrastructure. Rowland's other direct reports include Alexander Coppess, Andy Kim, Lee Meyer, and Liz Balke.\nRowland's team is primarily based out of Memphis, but he has one employee listed as a data center technician based in Atlanta.\nBI was unable to confirm details of Rowland's professional background. A hardware engineer named Daniel Rowland has worked on Tesla's Dojo supercomputer since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile and internal documentation reviewed by BI.\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nBabuschkin previously worked at Google DeepMind.\nBabuschkin manages the most people directly at xAI, with 29 direct reports. One of his team members includes Kai Musk, Elon Musk's son, according to the chart. Musk is listed in xAI's directory as an \"Engineering Intern\" on the company's \"Engineering Strike Team.\" His involvement with the company has not been previously reported.\nWhen asked about his position at the company, Kai Musk responded from his xAI email address that \"this information is incorrect.\" He declined to comment further and did not respond to follow-up questions.\nBabuschkin also oversees members of the company's \"xAI Partner\" department, including Marko Elez and Aram Moghaddassi, two people who have been connected to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\nBoth previously worked at Musk's X and Neuralink, according to Moghaddassi's LinkedIn profile and an archived version of Elez's LinkedIn profile. Elez was listed as an \"active\" employee at xAI in February; four days after BI reached out to xAI about his employment, his company email address stopped working.\nOther people listed as members of the xAI Partner department under Babuschkin include Aqueel Miqdad and Anton Shevchenko, who both list X as their current employer on LinkedIn.\nBirchall is listed as an \"xAI Partner\" on the organizational chart, but he does not report to Babuschkin. His team includes members of the finance, legal, security, and HR teams. His direct reports include Robert Ochoa, the human resources lead; Robert Keele, the legal lead; and Pablo Mendoza, the finance lead.\nBirchall, like Rowland, is listed as a remote employee.\nThe former Morgan Stanley banker also serves as the CEO of Musk's brain chip startup, Neuralink, and he has run Musk's family office for nine years.\nNordeen has no direct reports. He was a technical program manager at Tesla before he joined xAI in 2023, according to an internal Tesla database from December 2021.\nDo you work for xAI or one of Musk's companies?

            "full_content": "By \n\n\tMichael Schneider\n\nVariety Editor at Large\n\n\tDisney is looking at new ways to engage young fans, Dana Walden told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on Tuesday. Walden, the co-chairman of Disney Entertainment at the Walt Disney Co., told media analyst Ben Swinburne that the company is aiming to target kids and young families on the social media platforms where they consume a lot of content — especially YouTube. \n\n\t“They’re clearly on YouTube,” Walden said. “And we have a meaningful and great partnership with YouTube. We produce thousands of videos based on our series specifically for YouTube. Disney Junior, I think, has 22 million subscribers. We do that because we know that’s where kids like to consume content. Along with Disney+, we want to keep them engaged. We want to keep incubating IP on a platform that’s important to creators and kids.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tVIP+\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSyndication of Streaming Originals Will Be the Next Content Trend\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGreg Hessinger, Former SAG Leader, Tapped to Head AMPTP\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo that end, Walden hinted at “the work we’re doing now, although I have nothing specific to announce on the technology side, are features that will specifically address how kids are interacting with content right now in a very contemporary way… looking holistically at that kids audience, we know we have the stories that they love. We’re working on the technology that will allow them to engage with them in a in the way they want.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBeyond that, Walden touched on the upcoming launch of the ESPN over-the-top service — currently dubbed “ESPN Flagship” — which will feature the ESPN networks outside of the cable bundle for the first time, in addition to ESPN+. Walden suggested ESPN boss Jimmy Pitaro would have more information, but added, “I’ve seen a little bit and it’s incredibly exciting. The new features that they’ll bring to market with the launch of Flagship, I think are really going to blow people away.”\n\n\tWalden added that sports is also an important element for Disney+, especially now that the service includes an ESPN tile (which features programming like “30 For 30”). “It’s of enormous value to these subscribers,” she said. “It’s over 3000 hours of long form programming. And then yesterday, we actually launched something I’m very excited about, which is SC+. It is a daily ‘SportsCenter’ show produced by SportsCenter and ESPN. It is going to help us, I think, to include people who are casual sports fans in this conversation that is obviously dominating cultures around the world. A daily touch point for sports on Disney+, a reason every day to open the app.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTouting the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ offerings, Walden said the company was “enormously proud of all we’ve accomplished in streaming, especially over the past two years. As you well know, not too long ago, we were losing over a billion dollars a quarter. We are now profitable, growing revenue and delivering,  with visibility towards double digit margins.” That includes the recent launch of Hulu on Disney+. “It’s an extraordinary value for subscribers,” she said. “It’s driving engagement… and cause for extreme optimism about our future.”\n\n\tOn the international front, Walden also sees “tremendous opportunity” for growth: “It’s still a very young platform. We’re working on our local originals so that we have content around the world that is relevant to local subscribers, along with our big global hits. Our company is producing and releasing in streaming a huge number of hits that travel around the world.\n\n\t“Creating a pipeline of content takes some time, but the great news is, in each of the regions, we found bonafide hits,” she said. “For example, in Korea last year, we released a show called ‘Moving’ that signed up over a million and a half subscribers and created a huge event in that market — along with all of the rest of the content from the United States. We’re doing local for local, and then local for regional, and then global for the whole world.”\n\n\tAs for domestic hits, Walden pointed to the tremendous success of FX’s “Shogun,” which has just completed an impressive Season 1 string of wins at the Emmys, Golden Globes, Critics Choice, SAG Awards and more. And, with the writers’ room now wrapped for Season 2, expect firm news on the next season very soon.\n\n\t“We like to bake it carefully,” she said. “We will not release the Season 2 until it’s ready.”\n\n\t\t\tA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\t\t\nThe Business of Entertainment"

Das gab Vorstandschef Christian Sewing auf einer von Morgan Stanley organisierten Konferenz bekannt. Aus Kostengründen hatte die Bank bereits in den vergangenen Jahren mehrfach Filialen geschlossen. Für 2025 spricht Sewing von einer \"signifikanten Anzahl\". \n\nNeben der Deutschen Bank sei auch die Tochter Postbank betroffen. Einem Konzernsprecher zufolge waren die Filialauflösungen schon im Vorfeld bekannt. Demnach soll die Zahl der Postbank-Filialen bis Mitte 2026 von 550 auf etwa 300 halbiert werden. Bei der Deutschen Bank soll es um eine \"mittlere zweistellige Zahl an kleineren Filialen\" gehen.\n\nIm Herbst 2024 hatte die Deutsche Bank Pläne bekannt gegeben,\n wonach die Kundenberatung zunehmend per Video und Telefon erfolgen \nsoll. Daraufhin hatte das Unternehmen mit weltweit rund 90.000 \nMitarbeitenden Verhandlungen mit dem Betriebsrat angekündigt.\n\nUnter dem Titel \"Deutsche Bank 3.0\" hatte der Vorstandschef im Januar dann ein neues Umbauprogramm angekündigt. Kosteneinsparungen durch schlankere Hierarchien und Künstliche Intelligenz sollen den Konzern effizienter und profitabler machen. Nach dem Umsatzrückgang im vergangenen Jahr soll die Eigenkapitalrendite 2025 auf mehr als zehn Prozent steigen.\n\nBei den nun verkündeten Maßnahmen handele es sich um kein neues Sparprogramm. Die Stellen würden aufgrund der Schließungen sowie Einsparungen im kundenbezogenen Geschäftsprozess abgebaut. Die Kosten für den Personalabbau seien bereits bereitgestellt worden, sagte Sewing.\n\n\n            Hier können Sie interessante Artikel speichern, um sie später zu lesen und wiederzufinden.\n        \n\n            Sie haben bereits ein Konto?\n            Hier anmelden."

            "full_content": "Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners.\nIn today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things.\nMarkets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office.\nTech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat.\nBusiness: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post.\nBut first, we're taking it slow.\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\nThe economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short.\nPresident Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year.\nNeil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish.\nThe market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently.\nThat's a key benchmark of DOGE's success — lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers — but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven.\nDutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming — consumer and government spending — showing signs of strain.\nTo Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year.\nHe's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors — tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending — for why he was \"actually pretty negative for the first time in a while\" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed.\nThe Point72 founder said he expects a \"significant correction.\"\nTruist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral.\nPredictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration.\nBefore the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change.\nBut in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as \"potential growth headwinds.\"\nAll this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial \"heart attack\" if not addressed.\nBut Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system.\n​​\"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy,\" he said.\n1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble — down as much as 13% from its January high — and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern.\n2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games — these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more.\n3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul.\n1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations — and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call.\n2. Is having Palantir on your résumé the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring.\n3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect — and how much it'll cost.\n1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint \"is nothing more than disgruntled former members.\"\n2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support \"free markets\" and \"personal liberties,\" he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil.\n3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.\nThe Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

            "full_content": "Despite growing concerns over future demand for artificial intelligence chips, both Meta (META+0.99%) and OpenAI can’t seem to get enough right now. \nBoth companies are seeing “significant capacity constraints” for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential for training and inferencing generative AI models, analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS+0.62%) said in a note highlighting takeaways from the firm’s Tech, Media & Telecom 2025 conference.\n“[A]t a high level these comments are consistent with our thematic framework where a small number of leading companies (or individuals) are focused on training/building the leading LLM ... which will require significant compute,” the analysts said. \nMeta uses GPUs for more than training its AI models, the analysts noted, including for ranking and recommending content and ads across its social media platforms. The tech giant “indicated that multiple teams are still waiting for GPUs,” the analysts said.\nMorgan Stanley noted that Meta “continues to be the company delivering the most incremental ROIC [return on invested capital]” from its investments in generative AI. Earlier this year, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI said that its GPU supply “is completely saturated,” and that it has never been in the position “where it can’t sell out access to its GPUs at reasonable margins,” according to the analysts.\nAccess to data, however, is not a constraint for OpenAI’s model development, Morgan Stanley said. The AI startup said that it can create synthetic data — or non-human, computer generated data — with its existing compute to meet its needs.\nNeither OpenAI nor Meta immediately responded to a request for comment from Quartz. \nOpenAI chief executive Sam Altman also said at the conference that he sees AI’s potential to cause deflation “as most underappreciated/misunderstood by investors,” according to the analysts. Altman’s views are aligned with the analysts’ previous thematic work showing that increasing efficiency in accessing AI models could “help offset inflation,” Morgan Stanley said.\nAfter Chinese AI startup DeepSeek demonstrated models on par with those from OpenAI and Meta for seemingly far less money and with weaker GPUs, investors were spooked, sparking a global sell-off of tech stocks. Despite challenging Big Tech’s billions in spending on AI infrastructure, analysts have said that more efficient AI models could make the technology cheaper and more accessible. \nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "China está impulsando abiertamente el desarrollo de robots humanoides como su próxima gran revolución tecnológica tras su éxito con los coches eléctricos. Hace unos días, según cuenta Nikkei, Shenzen activó un plan que incluye financiación y apoyo político para fomentar avances en componentes, chips de IA y tecnologías biomiméticas.\nPor qué es importante. Es un movimiento que coincide y mucho con los planes de Elon Musk con Tesla, cuyo robot Optimus podría empezar su producción a finales de este año, primero para uso interno y luego para comercializar a partir de 2026.\nEsta convergencia tiene mucho que ver con la entrada de Tesla en China y el efecto que tuvo al transformar su industria de coches eléctricos.\nEn cifras. Un 56% de las 100 empresas cotizadas dedicadas a la robótica tienen su sede en China, según un informe de Morgan Stanley. Además, el 45% de las empresas que personalizan robots para el usuario final son chinas.\nEl contexto. Este plan llega acompañado de varias iniciativas similares desde 2023. Shanghai quiere crear una industria de robótica de 1 billón de yuanes (unos 137.000 millones de dólares) este año. Mientras, Pekín ha anunciado un fondo de 13.000 millones de dólares para robótica y un centro de innovación humanoide.\nPaul Gong, jefe de investigación automotriz en UBS Investment Bank, describe a Musk como el \"líder espiritual\" del sector, papel que también desempeñó con los vehículos eléctricos. \"La introducción del concepto de robot humanoide ha llevado a muchas empresas chinas a explorar esta dirección\", señala.\nLa amenaza. La intensificación de tensiones geopolíticas podría tener consecuencias. Lu Hanchen, director de Shenzhen Gaogong Industry Research, advierte que Estados Unidos podría restringir la exportación de robots Optimus a China y bloquear la entrada de robots humanoides chinos al mercado estadounidense, aludiendo a preocupaciones sobre seguridad y gestión de datos.\n¿Y ahora qué? Según proyecciones de Bernstein Research, los robots humanoides podrían alcanzar:\nLa colaboración con proveedores chinos será básica para Tesla. Al mismo tiempo, las empresas chinas se moverán intentando reducir la dependencia de componentes extranjeros.\nEs una interesante paradoja: Washington y Pekín tienen una relación cada vez más tensa, pero al mismo tiempo sus ecosistemas industriales siguen entrelazados. La carrera por los robots humanoides se intuye como otro escenario en el que la dependencia mutua y la competencia atroz entre ambos bloques tendrán que convivir a la fuerza. Y la figura de Musk ganará enteros en ese choque.\nEn Xataka | Unitree es una de las joyas tecnológicas chinas.

Sie wurde automatisch von der Deutschen Presse-Agentur (dpa) übernommen.\nDie Deutsche Bank will im laufenden Jahr rund 2.000 Stellen streichen und die Zahl ihrer Filialen weiter reduzieren. Vorstandschef Christian Sewing sprach auf einer von Morgan Stanley organisierten Konferenz von einer «signifikanten Anzahl» von Filialen. Die Kosten für den Stellenabbau seien bereits bereitgestellt, sagte der Manager. \n\nDie Deutsche Bank hat in den vergangenen Jahren immer wieder Filialen geschlossen, um die Kosten zu drücken, und einen weiteren Abbau angekündigt. \n\nEin Konzernsprecher sagte, bei den Filialschließungen handle es sich um bereits bekannte Maßnahmen. Im Zuge dessen und bei Einsparungen im Backoffice, also bei der Abwicklung kundenbezogener Geschäftsprozesse, würden die genannten Stellen entfallen. Es gebe kein neues Sparprogramm.\n\nDie Deutsche Bank hatte im vergangenen September bekanntgegeben, dass sie Privatkunden stärker per Video und Telefon beraten will und zugleich eine «mittlere zweistellige Zahl» an kleineren Filialen schließen will. Im Zuge dessen hatte der Dax-Konzern Verhandlungen mit dem Betriebsrat angekündigt. Das Institut beschäftigt rund 90.000 Menschen weltweit. Allein in Deutschland betreibt die Deutsche Bank rund 380 Filialen und 470 bei der Postbank.\n\nVorstandschef Sewing hatte erst Ende Januar ein neues Umbauprogramm angekündigt mit dem Titel «Deutsche Bank 3.0». So sieht das Management Potenzial, durch schlankere Hierarchien und mehr Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz Kosten zu senken. Sewing will die Bank effizienter machen: Die Eigenkapitalrendite soll 2025 auf mehr als zehn Prozent steigen nach 4,7 Prozent im vergangenen Jahr. \n\n2024 hatte die Deutsche Bank schlechter abgeschnitten als erwartet: Vor Steuern verdiente sie knapp 5,3 Milliarden Euro und damit sieben Prozent weniger als ein Jahr zuvor.\n\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250319-930-408709/2\n\n\n            Hier können Sie interessante Artikel speichern, um sie später zu lesen und wiederzufinden.\n        \n\n            Sie haben bereits ein Konto?\n            Hier anmelden."

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nAutonomous trucking is gaining the attention of Wall Street with Morgan Stanley initiating coverage of autonomous truck technology company Aurora Innovation on Monday. Ravi Shanker, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, writes that despite taking years longer than expected, “Trucking finally appears to be on the cusp of an autonomous future.”\nMorgan Stanley believes that Aurora is the most sophisticated on-highway, Class 8 autonomous solution among peers, with the April rollout of its commercial driverless operating being a key milestone for both Aurora and the industry. However, equity analysts are more bullish than industry executives, believing that the development of autonomous trucking “has achieved enough escape velocity to be considered a real and credible commercial option for many commercial fleets.”\nShanker writes that if all goes according to plan, the next 12 months will see the industry logging thousands of miles of driverless operations from trucking fleets, placing autonomous trucking in the same “real” category as passenger robotaxi fleets.\nCompared to the approximately half-dozen other autonomous trucking companies about to launch driverless commercial operations, Shanker notes that Aurora’s plans for its April driverless commercial launch give it a head start. Morgan Stanley also sees on-highway operations as the most complex task for autonomous trucking compared to peers like Kodiak and Gatik, which are revenue-generating today with adjacent applications like off-highway or last-mile.\nWhile Morgan Stanley deems Aurora the clear leader in the space for now, “We continue to believe that the market will likely end up being divided amongst several players over time.”\nThere is a caveat: Aurora’s leadership could allow the company to gain an insurmountable lead over its peers. That would require tying up key OEM, carrier and service partnerships.\nFor industry peers, the bright side is that there’s a large total addressable market, or the overall revenue opportunity for a product or service. Morgan Stanley estimates that nearly 90% of the $1.3 trillion U.S. domestic freight transportation market, or about $1.17 trillion, could eventually be accessible to autonomous trucking solutions.\nAutonomous trucking company Bot Auto announced on Tuesday its plans to schedule continuous driverless commercial freight operations in 2025. The company’s schedule includes a minimum four-month pilot program of regular driverless runs between Houston and San Antonio, hauling cargo for customers.\nIn an interview with FreightWaves, Xiaodi Hou, founder and CEO of Bot Auto, said this initiative is a major step forward following Bot Auto’s previous successful hub-to-hub demonstration in October. The initiative departs from the industry’s earlier approach of one-off demonstrations, instead focusing on sustained, real-world driverless operations.\n“The most predictable breakthroughs are the ones no one predicts,” said Hou. “2025 is going to be a big year. Look at what’s unfolding across our industry so far: Kodiak demonstrating driver-out capabilities in the Permian Basin, Aurora timing their Driver-Out pilot program, Fernride making strides in Europe and now Bot Auto setting our schedule.”Read the full article here.\nBenore Logistics Systems announced on Tuesday the addition of 14 Hyundai Xcient hydrogen fuel cell trucks to its fleet. Benore began with four hydrogen trucks and expanded to 14 total in February. This is in addition to the company’s eight electric vehicles. The partnership with Hyundai Motor Group originally came from Benore’s relationship with Glovis, the logistics arm of Hyundai Motor Group. The trucks are being used on dedicated routes in the Savannah, Georgia, area servicing the new Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America.\n“These hydrogen fuel cell trucks represent a significant step forward for Benore and our ability to deliver innovative, sustainable logistics solutions,” said Dennis Kunz, vice president of revenue strategy and operation development. “Our partnerships with both Hyundai and Glovis are key to our company’s mission and the values we prioritize around sustainability and exploring advanced technology.”\nThe release adds that as part of the partnership, Hyundai Motor Group manufactures the hydrogen trucks while HTWO Logistics, the joint venture between Hyundai and Glovis, oversees deployment of the fleet. Benore then manages the fleet’s daily logistics, “ensuring seamless Just-In-Time and Just-In-Sequence operations that meet the demands of the Glovis EV contract.”\nCommercial vehicle maker Isuzu North America Corp. recently announced it has selected Greenville County in South Carolina as the company’s new production base in the United States. Isuzu is a subsidiary of Isuzu Motors Ltd., and Isuzu Trucks have been in the North American market since 1984. The 1 million-square-foot facility set on over 200 acres is converting into an assembly plant to produce both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles, with a production capacity of 50,000 units per year. Operations are expected to begin in 2027.\nAurora’s lawsuit against the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is moving forward, with Land Line reporting the company has until April 9 to present its arguments. The FMCSA has until May 9 to respond. Final briefs are due June 20. The lawsuit came about after the FMCSA denied Aurora’s roadside warning device exemption request after Aurora and Waymo filed the petition in 2023.\nThe post Driverless trucking – ‘On the cusp’ of a revolution appeared first on FreightWaves.\nSign in to access your portfolio"

We’re primarily a subscription model. We’ve got a pretty good sense over time of the ability to kind of drive demand and revenue from our investments across the business. So we start with that, and then we also set our margin targets.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix Posts 'Adolescence' Star Owen Cooper's Audition Tape\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNetflix's 'Adolescence' Makes UK Ratings History\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“Then what’s left over is to spend into content. So then there’s the bottom-up exercise … as we look [at] those categories of content, across genres, across countries and regions and across original and licensed content, and where can we deliver highest impact. We’re a learning machine. So it’s fluid, it’s iterative. We look at it every quarter, every year, and iterate … It’s how in any given year that we can, in a responsible way, invest into the growth.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNetflix has a massive household audience of about 700 million globally. That’s “a huge variety and quality of content [and] we also have a principle that those stories, the best stories, can come from anywhere.”\n\n\tSolutions for password sharing have successfully boosted revenue and 2025 is a pivotal year for Netflix’ advertising tier.\n\n\tExecs said on the last earnings call that 55% of new signups were for the ad tier, which is approaching critical scale in all of the streamer’s ad markets. The focus in this year is to monetize that reach “because our monetization has now not kept up yet with the scale.” Investment is key, in expanding first-party ad tech stack, audience measurement, and a sales operation.\n\n\tLive events is a growth area too but, he insisted, as has co-CEO Ted Sarandos, that it’s a much broader category than sports.\n\n\t“Live creates more appointment viewing, more conversation … We saw with the Tom Brady roast. We saw, it with John Mulaney on the talk show side. We saw it with the [Jake] Paul-[Mike] Tyson fight, with the NFL on Christmas Day, and now with WWE. We are in those big, eventized moments” that help drive subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“But not all live content works for us … and being in the business of regular season, of full seasons of big sports, we haven’t found that yet to be something that we necessarily need to deliver.”\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

            "full_content": "By Peter White \nExecutive Editor, Television\n\nDana Walden made her debut at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\tWalden, whose title is Co-Chairman, Disney Entertainment, The Walt Disney Company, didn’t break news at the event but did talk up the success of FX’s Shōgun, while avoiding the topic of CEO succession.\n\n\tMany observers opined that her appearance had the hallmark of a senior executive making her case to Wall Street and investors that she should be the one to replace Bob Iger (who she sat next to at the Oscars on Sunday) when he steps down for a second time.\n\n\tWhen asked by Benjamin Swinburne, media and telecom analyst at Morgan Stanley, about leadership at Disney going forward, Walden said, “This is such a talented, I would say, gifted, group of leaders. It is a small leadership team who deliver so much value. The culture at Disney is excellent. This company is in incredibly good hands, and we’ve had the amazing opportunity to learn and work with Bob now, who I really could not think more highly of and I know that’s a sentiment that’s shared widely across our industry and across business in general. This company is in excellent hands, and I have amazing colleagues.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSwinburne highlighted the difficulties over the last few years including a “volatile” period for the industry with leadership changes, reorgs, the pandemic and the labor strikes in Hollywood. “It has been very rough for everyone in the room,” said Walden.\n\n\tWalden is widely considered one of the potential successors to Iger along with ESPN’s Jimmy Pitaro, theme parks and experiences chief Josh D’Amaro and her Disney Entertainment co-chairman Alan Bergman as well as a handful of external candidates.\n\n\tThe former Fox executive talked up Disney’s movie and TV slate at the event, highlighting shows such as Paradise, which dropped its finale today on Hulu, as well as Shōgun. She reminded people that the company won 60 Emmys in September including 18 for the period drama that included Outstanding Drama Series as well as 11 wins for The Bear.\n\n\t“That was more than any of our competitors ever. I think it is meaningful to point out that the rest of the industry split the other 69 awards, so [there is] value in the content and how we’re delivering it to our subscribers,” she said.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShōgun has been renewed for a second season. Co-creator, showrunner and executive producer Justin Marks told reporters backstage at the Golden Globes in January that the writers were finishing the writers room in February.\n\n\tStar Hiroyuki Sanada said at last month’s Critics Choice Awards that he is “very excited about the plan” for the 10-episode season. “I think the thing to take away, more than anything, is how, I hope people are going to be surprised with some of the big ideas as soon as the first episode of part two. So, we’ll start there and see where it takes us for future stories,” he added.\n\n\tWalden said that Disney and FX wouldn’t rush the process. “We like to bake it carefully. We will not release season two until it’s ready,” she added.\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

            "full_content": "Robert Thomson, a close ally of Rupert Murdoch and CEO of the media titan’s News Corp, said the initial “turmoil” of Donald Trump‘s time in the White House is certain to calm down in the coming months.\n\n\tSpeaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, Thomson said the whirlwind early weeks of Trump’s second term have unfolded at a pace that cannot be sustained. He pointed to Monday’s negative reaction to the president’s vow to initiate previously shelved tariffs against Canada and Mexico, calling it a check on the president’s impulsiveness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTikTok Hires Nathaniel Brown As Global Corporate Communications Chief; Ex-WBD Exec Joins Zenia Mucha's Team At Platform\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Atlantic's Editor Says Top Trump Officials Accidentally Texted Him U.S. Secret War Plans -- Update\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe “tariff turmoil” and other sources of “uncertainty” are not “what Chairman Mao used to call a ‘permanent revolution,'” Thomson said. “This is not a permanent revolution.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tInstead, the tariffs are “transactional” measures, the exec reasoned, and “there’s a certain method to the madness. If that’s the case, then in six to nine months’ time, for our businesses and for any business operating in the States or for any global company contemplating investment, the scenario will be somewhat different” than the current one.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews Corp’s media portfolio includes The Wall Street Journal, whose recent editorials have at times directly challenged Trump, calling his tariff plan a step toward “the dumbest trade war in history.” The news outlet has also clashed with Trump advisor Elon Musk after publishing investigative articles about his leadership of Tesla and other companies as well as his oversight of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\tOther parts of Murdoch’s media empire, especially Fox News at sister entity Fox Corp., have remained ardently supportive of Trump. Over the decade of Trump emerging as a prominent figure in presidential politics, Murdoch’s relationship with him has fluctuated noticeably, but has recently landed in a generally pragmatic place. Thomson himself, during a quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts last month, hailed Trump’s election win for lifting the “yoke of woke” from U.S. businesses.\n\n\tThomson at the Morgan Stanley event predicted that Corporate America would be able to ride out the storm.\n\n\t“If you were going in and wanting to disrupt, you would do it at the front end,” he said. “Then hopefully, and obviously the goal, is to change in terms of trade, to reduce the federal bureaucracy spend, etc. etc. Which is why, essentially DOGE has a limited timeline. But we’re in the midst of the early Trump 2 turmoil. The optimistic interpretation is, it’s purposeful turbulence.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWith Trump sensitive to the stock market and consumer price inflation data, “those two things themselves provide a natural discipline,” Thomson argued. “But there’s also no doubt that in the end he wants to be seen as a successful president. And a successful president presiding over four years of chaos is not a successful president. So, I would try to contextualize the upheaval in which we find ourselves. I’m of the more optimistic school, could be proved wrong.”\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

            "full_content": "Les perspectives sont trÃ¨s nÃ©gatives pour la sociÃ©tÃ© dirigÃ©e par Elon Musk.\nÂ« Nous avons du mal Ã  trouver un exemple analogue dans l’histoire de l’industrie automobile, oÃ¹ une marque a perdu autant de valeur aussi rapidement Â». Les analystes de la banque JP Morgan sont encore sous le choc de la baisse massive de lâaction Tesla observÃ©e au cours des derniÃ¨res semaines. Dans une note publiÃ©e ce mercredi 12 mars, ils ont dÃ©cidÃ© dâabaisser leurs prÃ©visions pour le cours de lâaction de la firme dâElon Musk de 230,58 $ Ã  135 $. Explications.\nIl faut tout dâabord signaler que ces perspectives partent dâun constat accablant : du mois de dÃ©cembre Ã  ce mercredi, la sociÃ©tÃ© a perdu 49 % de sa capitalisation boursiÃ¨re, passant dâun record de 1540 milliards de dollars Ã  environ 777 milliards de dollars.\nParmi les facteurs dâexplication, les experts mentionnent notamment lâengagement politique du patron de Tesla. Alors que beaucoup anticipaient quâil pourrait tirer avantage de sa position privilÃ©giÃ©e au sein du gouvernement, lâinverse semble se produire :\nLa collaboration de M. Musk avec le DÃ©partement de l’EfficacitÃ© gouvernementale a suscitÃ© une controverse aux Ãtats-Unis, et, si de nombreux membres de la droite s’en rÃ©jouissent autant que ceux de la gauche le dÃ©plorent, l’impact sur les ventes de Tesla semble nÃ©anmoins nÃ©gatif.\nDans une autre note publiÃ©e ce lundi, Morgan Stanley souligne Ã©galement dâautres impacts nÃ©gatifs du soutien Ã  Donald Trump, et notamment le mouvement social qui cible dÃ©sormais ouvertement le constructeur automobile :\nAujourd’hui, avec une baisse de 50 % de l’action, nos discussions avec les investisseurs se concentrent sur la distraction de la direction, la dÃ©gradation de la marque et la perte de ventes automobiles.\nEt pour tous ceux qui seraient tentÃ©s dâacheter des actions de lâentreprise, maintenant que son cours a baissÃ©, Ross Gerber, pourtant un investisseur historique de Tesla, le dÃ©conseille fortement :\nEn tant qu’investisseur traditionnel, elle ne correspond Ã  aucun systÃ¨me de valorisation pertinent par rapport Ã  d’autres actions. Surtout en cette pÃ©riode de correction oÃ¹ l’on pourrait acheter Nvidia Ã  20 fois ses bÃ©nÃ©fices. Et leurs bÃ©nÃ©fices attendus devraient augmenter de 75 % cette annÃ©e, et ils rachÃ¨tent des actions.\nLa perspective dâune baisse massive de lâaction Tesla serait catastrophique pour Elon Musk. Comme nous vous lâexpliquions cette semaine, sa fortune est Ã©troitement liÃ©e Ã  celle du constructeur. Un krach significatif du cours du titre pourrait donc fortement impacter son patrimoine.\nDe plus, il a contractÃ© des dettes garanties par ses actions Tesla pour financer d’autres projets (Twitter, SpaceX). Une chute continue pourrait le forcer Ã  revendre, entraÃ®nant une spirale baissiÃ¨re. Cette situation menace non seulement sa richesse, mais aussi son influence politique, qu’il exerce en faisant usage de ses moyens dÃ©mesurÃ©s.\nEn Europe aussi, lâimage de Tesla est en berne avec une baisse des ventes de 26 % en France. Nos confrÃ¨res de France Inter ont justement pu Ã©changer avec un salariÃ© du siÃ¨ge local du constructeur Ã  Saint-Ouen.\nCe dernier a confiÃ© son mal-Ãªtre face au management : Â« On nous met la pression en nous disant tout simplement, ‘si vous parlez, on vous vire’. On reÃ§oit un mail au moins une fois par semaine, nous rappelant les rÃ¨gles pour discuter en public de Tesla, que ce soit avec des amis ou avec des journalistes Â».\nIl souffre Ã©galement du regard du grand public et des clients qui font peser lâengagement politique dâElon Musk sur les Ã©paules des collaborateurs de la sociÃ©tÃ©. Mais câest la pression de sa direction, qui rendrait les salariÃ©s responsables de la chute des ventes qui le fait le plus enrager : Â« Ã leurs yeux, ce n’est pas la faute de notre dirigeant, mais notre faute Ã  nous en tant que salariÃ©s ! Je n’ai jamais vu un taux de burn-out aussi Ã©levÃ© que chez Tesla Ã  l’heure actuelle. Â» ContactÃ©e par la radio publique, Tesla nâa pas souhaitÃ© rÃ©agir.\nð Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur Google ActualitÃ©s et WhatsApp.\nAbonnez-vous, et recevez chaque matin un rÃ©sumÃ© de lâactu tech\n          \tJ'ai lu et accepte        \t          \tles termes et les conditions        \t  \n\n                [ SOURCE ]\n              \n\nÃ la uneElon MuskTesla \nEnquÃªte : plongÃ©e dans lâAmÃ©rique qui prÃ©pare une rÃ©volte pacifique contre Donald Trump\nEssai Tesla Model Y RestylÃ© : le roi des SUV conserve son trÃ´ne\nLe Tesla Model Y RestylÃ© est disponible en France : tout ce qu’il faut savoir\nLe gÃ©ant chinois de la voiture Ã©lectrique BYD laisse Tesla dans son rÃ©troviseur\n\n                Suivez-nous\n              \n\n                Suivez-nous"

            "full_content": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go – because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. \nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. \nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. \nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February – although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% – as well as in Australia. \nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day – adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y – with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada – although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes – significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake – currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings – a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles – which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers – or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment –  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nWall Street banks are starting to cut what could be thousands of workers as new economic uncertainties mount.\nIn recent weeks, Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Bank of America (BAC) all began workforce reductions that affect various parts of their operations.\nThe layoffs come at a time of the year when it is common for Wall Street to cull some underperformers and trim staff as part of annual reviews.\nThe cuts also come at a time when hopes for an IPO bonanza and dealmaking boom in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test due to uncertainties surrounding the Trump administration’s trade policies.\nMorgan Stanley is planning to cut around 2,000 workers by the end of the first quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe reductions will affect front-office and back-office employees across all units. They won’t include Morgan Stanley’s army of 15,000 financial advisers, but the layoffs will affect some people working for the advisers in support functions.\nThe person familiar with the moves said they are part of the bank’s ongoing process of assessing its resource needs based on its business priorities, location strategy, and employee performance globally.\n\"It's really about operational efficiency,\" the person said, adding that \"it doesn't relate to market conditions.\"\nGoldman Sachs is planning cuts amounting to 3% to 5% of its workforce. Its headcount at the end of 2024 was 46,500.\nThe reductions are part of its annual trimming of underperformers.\n\"Like other banks, this is part of our normal, annual talent management process,\" a Goldman Sachs spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, declining to discuss specifics.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the culling will focus on vice presidents and that CEO David Solomon has told senior executives that in recent years the bank hired too many vice presidents relative to overall hiring.\nAt Bank of America, the company cut 150 junior investment bankers, the Wall Street Journal first reported on Monday.\nThe move comes weeks after a larger reduction as part of BofA’s annual review process, first reported by Reuters.\nThat reduction amounted to cutting 1% of staff across Bank of America’s global banking and markets divisions and included managing directors, directors, and vice presidents, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMore cuts this year are also possible at Citigroup (C) since that bank is a little more than halfway through a two-year reduction plan that is part of a sweeping restructuring effort under CEO Jane Fraser.\nTo meet that plan by the end of 2026, Citi must reduce its headcount by 10,000 workers plus another 40,000 in connection with the sale of its Mexico-based consumer bank, Banamex.\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country’s largest bank, hasn’t disclosed outright reductions but has indicated it is backing off hiring after adding roughly 50,000 more workers over the past four years.\nBarron's reported the bank laid off “fewer than 1,000 employees” in February, with plans for more cuts in the coming months.\n“We have grown a lot,” CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts in January. “You have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced.”\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nSign in to access your portfolio"

More during the final round of THE PLAYERS Championship on THE PLAYERS Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass on March 12, 2023 in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. (Photo by Sam Greenwood/Getty Images)\nMorgan Stanley has been a proud partner of the PGA Tour’s de facto fifth major since 2016, making this week’s edition the financial services giant’s tin cup anniversary.\nLast year, to mark the Players 50th edition, the firm presented an augmented reality experience on mobile devices aimed at both fans onsite at TPC Sawgrass as well as those watching the tourney from home. 11-time PGA Tour winner, Justin Rose, Morgan Stanley’s brand ambassador, served as a golf culture sherpa, setting the scene of iconic moments and often injecting wit and levity—\"I hope that pond was gator-free,” the affable Englishman quipped after one storied moment.\n“Tour Through Time was such a fun project. It was really cool to celebrate the history of this iconic tournament and to recognize some epic moments at TPC Sawgrass,” Justin Rose said.\nThey’re once again showcasing leading technology, this time with a nifty AI Course Setup Tool powered by AWS. The tool assists agronomists, tour officials and field staff by allowing them to forecast how each hole will play during the tournament.\nRose is stoked to see how insights from predictive artificial intelligence impact play while also offering a glimpse into future applications—like preemptively assessing how even subtle architectural changes, from adding trees to adjusting landforms, will affect scoring.\n“It is being used for the very first time this week, and I think we will be feeling the ripples of the introduction of this AI technology into the game of golf for years to come. It’s exciting to see it launch,” he added.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley chief marketing officer Alice Milligan, the new app leverages AI to optimize tee and hole locations using the foresight of simulated results that take into account everything from driving distance to the extent to which the rough penalizes missed fairways. While officials have always made educated guesses about setup impact, this tool crunches numbers in a way that should bring more precision to the task while also speeding up decision making.\n“The opportunity to bring this modern technology to a very manual process with a groundbreaking tool and app feels like a natural next step for what we were doing in the space of innovation over the past few years,” Milligan said.\nGiving back has long been a hallmark of the sponsorship. Over the past decade Morgan Stanley has donated nearly $2 million to charitable organizations nationwide, including First Tee, through its Eagles for Impact campaign, which donates $5,000 for every double-circled score on pros’ scorecards. This year, a fan experience tied to that initiative will further ratchet up the tournament’s charitable impact.\nMorgan Stanley hospitality area setup at the Players Championship.\nReflecting on the Players partnership, Mandell Crawley, chief client officer at Morgan Stanley, who was chief marketing officer at the inception of the relationship, also emphasized the tournament’s philanthropic importance and its alignment with the firm’s core values.\n“One of the hallmarks of any longstanding brand partnership is a commitment to shared values. Since we teamed up with the Players in 2016 we have consistently collaborated to give back to the communities we serve and inspire the next generation of leaders, on and off the course,” he said.\nMorgan Stanley has come to view the exclamation point on the tour’s Florida Swing as a kindred spirit and The Players has become a key tentpole marketing event for them. With last year’s partnership renewal, the firm’s commitment to The Players isn’t just a long-term play—it’s a cornerstone of its sports marketing strategy."

            "full_content": "Netflix is doubling down on providing more content this year. According to the streaming giant’s CFO Spencer Neumann, Netflix is expecting to spend $18 billion USD in cash on content for 2025. \nHeading towards greater expansion, Neumann spoke at the 2025 Morgan Stanley Tech, Media & Telecom Conference telling the audience, “We’re not anywhere near a ceiling.” In regards to Netflix as a global entertainment company, he said, “I think we are still just getting started.” The $18 billion USD cash content spending would be an 11% increase from last year’s $16.2 billion USD. Neumann also spoke of the anticipated revenue from the spending and reveals that Netflix has “pretty good predictability about [it]” as the spending is seen as a way of achieving margin targets. \nAt the end of 2024, Netflix had 301.6 million paid members globally, with an accelerating growth from 2023. With 700 million people watching Netflix content across the world, the streaming giant is in about 40% of connected TV households around the world and has captured 6% of its addressable market. In the U.S. and other countries, Netflix still represents less than 10% of total TV viewing. Neumann said, “We see the opportunity to grow everywhere. It’s more about, where is the biggest opportunity to grow and spend…We want to stay in growth mode versus maintenance mode as long as possible.” The platforms goals remain “more and more entertainment value per dollar,” while also focusing on the overall experience “because the competition is improving as well.” With the help of Netflix’s chief content officer Bela Bajaria, the company agrees it has to “start with big, local impact” with ““authentic storytelling” and once “those stories are great they can occasionally travel.” \nFor 2025, Netflix raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion USD and $44.5 billion USD, $500 million USD from previous guidance. In January 2025, Netflix announced price hikes in the U.S. and other markets across all plans.\n\n                                                \n                                                                                                    \n\n                                                            Read Full Article\n                                                        \n\n\nFor 2025, Netflix raised its 2025 outlook for revenue to be between $43.5 billion USD and $44.5 billion USD, $500 million USD from previous guidance.

            "full_content": "There are no new alerts at this time\nMore than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.\nIn total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.\nWhile a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.\nWhen asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.\nOn the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”\nTo be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.\nJonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.\nJust 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.\nMusk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.\nMusk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.\nDespite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.\nAfter a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla vehicles parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.\nTrump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

            "full_content": "The worst of the stock market sell-off looks like it's just about over.\nThat's according to top Wall Street forecasters who say they expect a more positive trajectory for stocks after the latest tariff-induced decline.\nConcerns surrounding President Donald Trump's trade war and the prospect of a recession in the US helped wipe away about $5 trillion in market cap in the S&P 500 in recent weeks, taking the benchmark index solidly into correctional territory. Stocks capped off their worst weekly performance in two years last Friday. But Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts said the market may have found a bottom.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said there are five reasons the sell-off appears to be over and stocks should start to recover.\nFirst, the bank said major stock averages entered oversold territory last week. The S&P 500 traded close to 5,500 on Thursday, at the low end of the bank's expected trading range for the index in the first half of 2025.\nSecond, sentiment and positioning gauges for the benchmark index have started to \"lighten up considerably,\" a sign more upside is on the way.\nThird, seasonal indicators look like they've improved going into the second half of the month.\nFourth, the US dollar has weakened in recent weeks, which could spark a wave of positive corporate earnings revisions as companies log stronger sales in overseas markets.\nFinally, lower interest rates this year could help boost economic surprise indexes in the US, which could also help send stocks higher, the bank said.\n\"We stand by our call from last week that 5,500 should provide support for a tradable rally led by cyclical, lower quality, and expensive growth stocks that have been hit the hardest and where the short base is the greatest. Friday's price action seems to support that call,\" Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, wrote on Monday.\nCiti seemed to agree.\nAnalysts said the latest sell-off had taken the S&P 500 to a healthier valuation. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven tech stocks also appear more \"rationally valued,\" the bank said. The group of top tech stocks now accounts for about 9 percentage points of the S&P 500's total return since December 2023, down significantly from last year's highs.\nThe S&P 500 is also down 10% from its record high in February. The decline is balancing the risk-reward of stocks \"to the upside,\" analysts said.\n\"This past week, we drew a line in the sand at 5,500 as a level where the risk-reward begins to skew more favorably,\" they wrote.\n\"Longer-term, we remain fundamentally constructive on the S&P 500 setup as productivity improvement, AI promise, operating leverage, shareholder influences, and ongoing business model maturation elements better describe our view of US exceptionalism,\" they added.\nCiti's positive outlook is notable given that the bank recently also recalibrated its view of US stocks, downgrading the market to \"neutral,\" while boosting its view of Chinese equities to \"overweight.\"\nMorgan Stanley and Citi analysts are sticking to year-end price targets of 6,500 for the benchmark index. That would be a gain of about 15% by the end of 2025.\nSome pessimism, though, is still percolating on Wall Street as traders eye the potential for a growth slowdown in the US.\nIn recent days, Goldman Sachs and RBC have downgraded their price targets for the S&P 500 to 6,200.\nWhile not its base case, Citi said it thought the S&P 500 could fall as low as 5,100, assuming that policy uncertainty and growth fears would continue to weigh on sentiment.\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, thinks the index could drop as low as 4,600 in the event of a recession, an 18% decline from Monday's levels.\n\"We also think it's important for the S&P 500 to respond to the ~5500 level given the fundamental and technical support there. If it doesn't, that's a potential sign that growth could be deteriorating faster than expected, and recession risk could be increasing along with the odds of our bear case outcome,\" analysts said.\nOne thing seems clear: Markets shouldn't expect the Trump administration to swoop in and save stocks anytime soon. The president's team has repeatedly indicated that it isn't focused on markets, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that he was \"not at all\" concerned about the recent drop in stocks.\n\"I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal. What's not healthy is straight up,\" Bessent told NBC over the weekend, adding that he believed the market would perform \"great\" over the long term.\nHis remarks came a week after Trump refused to rule out a US recession as a result of the administration's policies."

That's according to the Ubisoft minority shareholder AJ Investments, which said in a memo that it might organize a protest at Ubisoft's office in Paris to help elevate its concerns and get attention.\nAJ Investments CEO Juraj Krupa said in a statement seen by IGN that Ubisoft is \"horribly mismanaged by current management.\" The investment group, which previously urged Ubisoft management to make drastic changes, said Ubisoft needs to disclose a \"clear roadmap for recovery\" amid \"declining shareholder value, lackluster operational execution, and failure to adapt effectively to market trends.\"\nKrupa went on to say that the private financial market platform MergerMarket carried a story that claims Ubisoft was talking to Microsoft, EA, and other companies about potentially acquiring unspecified franchises from Ubisoft. Krupa said Ubisoft management failed to disclose these discussions publicly.\nA spokesperson for Ubisoft reiterated what it said months ago, which is that Ubisoft is in the process of conducting a strategic review of \"transformation strategic and capitalistic options,\" but that the company does not plan to make public announcements until a possible deal materializes.\nIn addition to possibly Microsoft and EA, Ubisoft is reported to possibly be in discussions with Tencent about some kind of financing deal. It remains to be seen how this might all materialize, but one possibility that's rumored is Ubisoft selling off individual franchises.\nKrupa added that the latest delay for Assassin's Creed Shadows to March 20 caused Ubisoft's stock to decline in value, but mainly retail investors were harmed by this--not institutional investors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Because Ubisoft did not act \"appropriately,\" as AJ Investments sees it, the company is asking frustrated investors to join a protest planned for May.\nKrupa said AJ Investments will call of its protest if Ubisoft's strategic review leads to an end result that increases shareholder value. It also hasn't ruled out suing Ubisoft.\n\"Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change,\" Krupa said.\nAs mentioned, Ubisoft's next big release is Assassin's Creed Shadows on March 20. It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included mass layoffs and studio closures, as well as the shutdown of XDefiant.\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

            "full_content": "Amazon is investing billions of dollars in robots to make its e-commerce business more efficient and profitable. This huge initiative started out a lot smaller.\nA decade ago, the company launched a competition for university engineering teams called the Amazon Picking Challenge. It called on researchers to design robots for a common warehouse task: grabbing products from a shelf and putting them in a box.\nAs a tech reporter, I was intrigued by this quirky project. At the time, in early 2015, Google was testing self-driving cars, a technology that emerged from a similar academic competition known as the DARPA Grand Challenge. What if Amazon was trying to replicate this magic, but with robots rather than automobiles?\nThen a funny thing happened. The Amazon Picking Challenge faded away. It was renamed, and it lasted only a few years. I chalked this up to another bad call and moved on.\nI thought about this challenge again late last year. Amazon had unveiled a next-generation warehouse in Louisiana with 10 times the robots moving products around and, yes, picking them up with dexterity. The company has said the facility is designed to process orders faster and more efficiently, and it's likely to be the future of its e-commerce operation.\nTen years after the Amazon Picking Challenge, the fruits of this nerdy competition have finally emerged. It follows an uncannily similar timeline as the DARPA Grand Challenge, which started in 2004 and resulted in Google's driverless cars hitting the road roughly a decade later.\nSo, with the help of Business Insider's Eugene Kim, I investigated how Amazon's huge new fleet of picking robots came to be, and how this competition laid the foundation for a new wave of automation that's about to crash over the warehouse and logistics industry.\nIt started with an acquisition. In 2012, Amazon paid $775 million for Kiva Systems, which designed flat robots that zip around warehouse floors.\nThis helped move pallets of goods around, but humans still needed to pick items. Getting a robot to spot the correct product in a box, then grab it just hard enough to pick it up but not damage it — that's incredibly difficult.\nThis is where the Amazon Picking Challenge came in. Instead of hacking away at this problem itself, the company wanted to focus the broader academic community on it.\nThe risk was that any valuable inventions would be out in the public sphere and Amazon might not directly benefit from them. But the potential gains were much bigger, according to executives and roboticists.\n\"Amazon doesn't compete with robotics companies,\" said Brad Porter, a former Amazon Robotics chief who now runs a robotics startup called Cobot. \"When facing an unsolved research problem in robotics AI, like bin picking, Amazon benefits if anyone solves that problem as long as Amazon can get access to the technology to improve their operations.\"\n\"The challenge Amazon was trying to solve was how to motivate researchers to focus on this problem,\" Porter added. \"The Picking Challenge very much succeeded in doing that.\"\nThe first competition took place over two days in late May 2015 in Seattle, with more than 25 teams from colleges including MIT, Duke, Rutgers, and Georgia Tech.\nThe contestants had to design a robot that could pick products from a typical shelf on a Kiva Systems warehouse pod and then put those items into containers. The picker had to be fully autonomous, and each robot was given 20 minutes to pick 12 target items from the shelves. Contestants had to open-source their creations.\nCompanies including ABB, Fanuc, and Rethink Robotics, founded by the industry pioneer Rodney Brooks, provided hardware for contestants to repurpose and tinker with.\nThe products were 25 items commonly sold on Amazon.com, including packs of Oreo cookies, boxes of Sharpie pens, and dog toys.\nSome were easier to pick; there were simple cuboids, like a box of coffee stirrers or a whiteboard eraser. Others were trickier. For instance, a box of Cheez-Its couldn't be removed without first tilting it, adding another complex step for the robots. Smaller items, such as an individual spark plug, were more difficult to detect and grasp.\nA research paper analyzing the results said that among the 26 teams, a total of 36 correct items and seven incorrect items were picked. Another four were dropped by robots in the competition.\nAbout half of the teams scored no points, and two teams couldn't get their robots working well enough to even attempt the challenge, the paper said.\nProblems ranged from the highly technical to the mundane. Some items were packed in different ways, which made them even more difficult to pick. One team's machine had a vacuum hose that got accidentally wound around the robotic arm.\nThe researchers wrote that the failure of any one of a system's hundreds of components could lead to \"catastrophic failure of the overall system — as witnessed during the competition.\" \nThe main finding from this first Amazon Picking Challenge was that human warehouse workers were a lot better than machines at picking products.\n\"A human is capable of performing a more complex version of the same task at a rate of ∼400 sorts/hour with minimal errors,\" the researchers wrote, \"while the best robot in the APC achieved a rate of ∼30 sorts/hour with a 16% failure rate.\"\nBut the conclusion was hopeful, too: The contest showed that robotics could substantially increase warehouse automation and order fulfillment in the near future.\nThe following year the competition was renamed the Amazon Robotics Challenge, and the tasks evolved to be more complex.\nTye Brady, the chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, was involved in the later Amazon Robotics Challenges.\nIn a recent interview with Business Insider, he said research on robotic manipulation exploded from 2016 through 2018, with many institutions publishing their results and insights. This helped spread valuable knowledge across the industry, speeding up progress.\nAt least two professors started graduate-level classes related to Amazon's challenge, and these programs are still churning out experts with valuable practical applied knowledge in robotics, Brady said.\n\"When you get a whole bunch of smart people together in a room and think about focused problems, some great things are going to happen, and that's really what happened,\" he said. \"It inspired a lot of the work that we have today that we see in, for example, our Sparrow and Robin manipulation systems that are real-world products delivering packages inside of our fulfillment centers.\"\nIn that first competition in 2015, some robotics teams used grippers that mimicked the way a hand picks things up. Other teams tried suction, with some even strapping off-the-shelf vacuum cleaners to their robots.\nGripping proved more problematic because the robots didn't receive enough information to know when to release or add pressure at the right times. This could result in crushed products or dropped items.\nSucking the items up so they stuck to the end of robot arms was a more successful approach.\n\"The idea of high-flow suction was novel. Bring your favorite vacuum cleaner and start picking up objects. That was kind of clever,\" Brady said, adding: \"We used suction inside of our Robin and our Sparrow arms. It's very good.\"\nAmazon unveiled Robin, its first robotic arm, in 2021. This machine picks up packages from conveyor belts and places them on other mobile robots called Pegasus.\nSparrow followed in 2023. This was Amazon's first robotic arm to handle individual items rather than packages. It uses computer vision and AI to pick more than 200 million items from containers and place them in totes.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has taken notice. At the AWS re:Invent conference in December, he took time away from talking about cloud computing to wax lyrical about Sparrow.\n\"It has to discern which item is which. It has to know how to grasp that item, given the size of it and the materials and the flexibility of that material. And then it has to know where in the receiving bin it can put it,\" Jassy said. \"These are all inventions that are critical to us changing the processing time and the cost to serve our customers.\"\nWall Street has noticed, too. Morgan Stanley recently estimated that Amazon's warehouse robots could save the company as much as $10 billion a year.\n\"The big story is we're just getting started,\" Brady said."

            "full_content": "Many healthcare startups and investors are hoping for a fresh wave of M&A in 2025 after a slow few years for company combinations — and the right buyers might just be their startup peers.\nAt the end of 2024, many healthcare startups were quietly raising down rounds and looking around for buyers to extend their lifespans, Business Insider reported in November.\nWhile some startups are desperate for deals, nearly a dozen investors and bankers told BI in February that few large companies had the appetite to make big acquisitions in healthcare this year.\n\"In digital health, it's not necessarily that it doesn't make sense to consolidate — it's there's a lack of consolidators out there,\" said Aaron DeGagne, a senior healthcare analyst at PitchBook.\nBut those startups could find a new home with other digital health startups that are flush with cash. Several healthcare startups have been vocal about their M&A ambitions this year as they await dropping interest rates and are eager to jump on opportunities for inorganic growth.\nThese are seven healthcare startups that appear ready to make more acquisitions in 2025.\nLast fundraise: $180 million in Series C extension and growth debt expansion funding in August 2024.\nThe surgical software company Caresyntax is planning on using a fresh fundraise to power acquisitions.\nCaresyntax, which combines information from surgical videos, medical records, and other sources to help make surgeries safer and more profitable, grabbed $180 million in August. In a release about the funding round, the company said it was looking to make several acquisitions in 2024 and beyond.\nJosh Zeidman, Caresyntax's chief business officer, told BI the company was looking for acquisitions in areas such as surgical AI applications, video analytics, and data capture modules.\nHe said Caresyntax was primarily considering deals with venture-backed startups or other small private companies rather than with private equity or public companies.\nCaresyntax said in its August release that it had acquired multiple surgical data and technology assets in 2023, though it didn't name those acquisitions. Zeidman told BI that Caresyntax's primary get in 2023 was acquiring the team behind health data consulting company CQInsights, including its CEO, Dr. Bruce Ramshaw, who became Caresyntax's chief medical informatics officer.\nLast fundraise: $70 million from General Catalyst, as part of Commure's $6 billion merger with Athelas in October 2023\nM&A is a core part of the healthcare startup Commure's playbook.\nCommure, the health software company cofounded by General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja, has made seven acquisitions to date. Former employees told BI in September that Commure's leadership regularly touted the slogan \"M&A is in our DNA.\"\nMost recently, the startup bought the care coordination platform Memora Health in December.\nMemora Health was another General Catalyst investment, as was Athelas, the revenue cycle management company Commure merged with in 2023.\nCommure also announced in July a $139 million all-cash acquisition of the public medical scribing company Augmedix.\nCommure didn't respond to requests for comment for this story.\nLast fundraise: Sixth Street and other investors contributed an undisclosed amount of funding in 2021 to support Datavant's $7 billion merger with Ciox Health.\nThe health data startup Datavant is hunting for more deals after kicking off a fresh M&A push in the fall.\nCEO Kyle Armbrester told BI in January that the company, which has made 11 acquisitions since 2017, planned to make at least \"one or two\" more acquisitions in early 2025.\nDatavant manages patient data exchanges between providers, payers, and life sciences organizations. The private equity firm New Mountain Capital is Datavant's controlling shareholder.\nDatavant most recently made two deals in September: It bought the data privacy organization Trace Data and two data analytics products from the healthcare AI startup Apixio.\nArmbrester said Datavant was looking for companies building technology for healthcare providers and life sciences organizations, especially those with existing market traction.\n\"We're large and diversified, and I think we're in a really good space to take a smaller smarter and apply their logic or artificial intelligence or analytics across that vast network to see a lot of benefit,\" Armbrester said.\nFlare Capital Partners' Parth Desai told BI in December that he expected private-equity-backed healthcare companies to make tuck-in acquisitions in 2025 as they prepare for potential IPOs in 2026.\nLast fundraise: $400 million in Series E funding in October 2021\n2025 could be the year that Hinge Health finally goes public. Multiple investors and bankers told BI in February that the physical therapy startup was the best choice for the year's first digital health IPO, with margins more closely resembling a software company than a healthcare services provider.\nHinge Health hired banks including Morgan Stanley last year to prepare for a public market debut, hoping to go public in early 2025, BI reported in September.\nThose ambitions shouldn't preclude the startup from making acquisitions. Similar to Datavant, Hinge Health could look to notch some deals before an IPO to further its growth.\nCEO Daniel Perez told BI in October 2023 that Hinge Health was actively looking for smaller companies to acquire, a sentiment the startup echoed to Endpoints News at the start of 2024.\nThe company hasn't announced any acquisitions since then.\nHinge Health declined to comment for this story.\nLast fundraise: $275 million in Series F funding in January 2025\nInnovaccer is hoping to use a fresh mega-round to fuel acquisitions.\nAt the start of the year, the company announced its $275 million Series F round, a combination of primary and secondary investments from investors such as B Capital Group and Kaiser Permanente.\nLess than two weeks later, Innovaccer announced it had bought the actuarial analytics startup Humbi AI.\nInnovaccer also made two acquisitions last year, scooping up the healthcare marketing platform Cured in January 2024 and the pharmacy software company Pharmacy Quality Solutions that March.\nThe startup told Endpoints News this January that it was looking to buy more health tech companies this year. CEO Abhinav Shashank said Innovaccer was looking at companies working to enhance the patient experience, relieve administrative burdens for providers with automation, and decrease costs.\n\"Our acquisition strategy is to accelerate our roadmap by partnering with like-minded mission-driven companies that can help customers drive these transformations,\" Shashank said in a statement to BI.\nLast fundraise: $60 million in Series A funding in February 2024\nFabric, the only early-stage startup on this list, has centered M&A in its approach since its March 2023 launch. The healthcare startup said it planned to accelerate that strategy further this year.\nFabric made four acquisitions in 15 months, most recently buying the physician practice group TeamHealth's virtual care business in September. Before that, Fabric bought the virtual care business MeMD from Walmart, the asynchronous virtual care platform Zipnosis from Bright Health, and the generative AI startup Gyant.\nFabric sells software to help emergency rooms manage patients, including by directing them to telehealth services where appropriate. General Catalyst led its $60 million Series A round in February 2024.\nFabric's founder and CEO, Aniq Rahman, told BI in September that Fabric was starting to look at bigger acquisition targets.\n\"A lot of the companies that are struggling to go raise capital right now, or some of these larger businesses that are reevaluating their position in the market, are creating opportunities for us as well,\" he said. \"Pretty much every week, there's inbound coming in from investors that are like, we have assets in our portfolio that may be accretive to what you're doing with Fabric.\"\nRahman told BI in February that Fabric expected to ramp up its M&A strategy even more in 2025.\nHe said Fabric had \"already met with a few dozen companies this year around M&A\" and was watching opportunities across venture-backed startups, private-equity-owned companies, and even spinouts of public companies.\nLast fundraise: $126 million in Series D funding in May 2024\nTranscarent, the healthcare benefits navigation startup helmed by Glen Tullman, the former Livongo CEO, kicked off the year with a big acquisition.\nThe company announced in January that it would buy its fellow care navigation company Accolade from the public markets in a $621 million all-cash deal.\nIt's one of at least three deals Transcarent has made to date. The startup bought 98point6's virtual care tech and physician group in March 2023 and merged with the surgical care startup BridgeHealth in 2020.\nTranscarent's top M&A priority for 2025 is to successfully integrate Accolade into its business, CEO Glen Tullman told BI in a statement.\nStill, he said the company remained strategically opportunistic and was consistently evaluating opportunities for growth and innovation.\nTranscarent is backed by General Catalyst, which certainly hasn't shied away from M&A for its healthcare bets, as seen through Fabric and Commure's rich histories of acquisitions. Tullman's own investment firm, 7wire Ventures, also an investor in Transcarent, has similarly combined its own portfolio companies, most recently selling the mental health startup Caraway to the pediatric care company Summer Health in February.\nGeneral Catalyst and 7wire Ventures co-led Transcarent's $126 million Series D round in May."

            "full_content": "Netflix dépensera 18 milliards de dollars pour le contenu en 2025 et prévoit des augmentations de ce budget pour les prochaines années.\nPour se démarquer de la concurrence, Netflix investit massivement pour enrichir son catalogue. Et si les sommes actuellement dépensées par l’entreprise sont déjà astronomiques, celle-ci est prête à payer encore plus pour du contenu, dans les prochaines années. Selon les explications de Variety, Netflix prévoit de dépenser 18 milliards de dollars en 2025, pour son contenu.\nCela représente une hausse de 11 % par rapport aux dépenses de 2024, qui étaient de 16,2 milliards de dollars. Et, lors de la conférence Morgan Stanley Tech, Media & Telecom, Spencer Neumann, directeur financier chez Netflix, a indiqué que ce budget devrait encore augmenter dans les prochaines années.\n“Nous sommes loin d’un plafond”, a indiqué le directeur financier, selon Variety. Celui-ci a également évoqué le processus via lequel Netflix prévoit son budget pour le contenu. Et, en substance, ces prévisions sont liées aux prévisions de revenus de la plateforme, qui sont assez prévisibles. En tout cas, Netflix a un objectif de marque qu’il doit atteindre.\nEn tout cas, si Netflix prévoit de continuer à augmenter son budget de contenu dans les prochaines années, c’est probablement parce que celui-ci anticipe une croissance de ses revenus. Pour rappel, le SVOD a connu une forte croissance grâce à la fin du partage gratuit de mots de passe, et grâce à sa nouvelle offre abordable financée par de la publicité.\nAujourd’hui, cet abonnement avec publicité est un élément essentiel de son nouveau modèle économique. Et, pour rappel, à partir de 2025, l’entreprise cesse de déclarer régulièrement son nombre d’abonnés. En effet, l’entreprise indique que l’engagement est désormais le meilleur “proxy” pour évaluer la satisfaction des clients. Mais l’engagement est aussi le métrique dont dépend la croissance des revenus publicitaires de la plateforme.\nOn ne sait pas combien de personnes utilisent l’abonnement Netflix avec publicités, mais l’entreprise indique qu’au dernier trimestre 2024, dans les pays où cette offre est proposée, l’abonnement avec pub avait une part de 55 % sur les nouveaux abonnements. Netflix a aussi indiqué qu’en séquentiel, son abonnement avec publicité a connu une croissance de 30 %.\n📍 Pour ne manquer aucune actualité de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur Google Actualités et WhatsApp.\n\n                [ SOURCE ]\n              \nAdolescence (Netflix) : pourquoi la psychologue offre un demi-sandwich à Jamie\nAdolescence : pourquoi il ne faut pas passer à côté de la mini-série n°1 sur Netflix\nThe Electric State : pourquoi le film le plus cher de l’histoire de Netflix est si nul\nNetflix : même pas encore sorti, son film le plus coûteux déçoit déjà\n\n                Suivez-nous\n              \n\n                Suivez-nous"

            "full_content": "Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that.\nQraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR).\nBut this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way.\nAMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider.\n\"In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month,\" Tam said.\nA tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date.\n\"Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech,\" Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now.\nInstead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\nThe AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%).\nEven though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock.\n\"We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development,\" Tam said.\nAs for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker.\n\"We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot,\" Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm.\nAI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick.\nThe bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. \"Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month."

            "full_content": "Интересы AMD на технологической конференции Morgan Stanley представляла финансовый директор компании Джин Ху (Jean Hu), она поведала о положении дел в большинстве сегментов рынка, на которых представлена продукция компании. Предметом особой гордости является высокий спрос на процессоры Ryzen 9000, которые в некоторых торговых сетях заняли около 70 % рынка.\nИсточник изображения: AMD\n«Мы очень довольны показателями нашего бизнеса в клиентском сегменте. Если посмотреть не только на настольный сегмент, но и ноутбуки, у нас лучшее портфолио продуктов. Наши настольные процессоры Ryzen 9000 распроданы, буквально, во всех торговых сетях. Во многих из них можно наблюдать, что мы достигли 70 % рынка», — не без гордости пояснила Джин Ху.\nПо её словам, розничные продажи процессоров AMD оставались высокими не только в четвёртом квартале, но и после январских каникул в Китае. По мнению финансового директора компании, стабильный спрос на процессоры Ryzen обусловлен их высоким быстродействием в играх и приятным пользовательским опытом, который они обеспечивают.\n\nВ сегменте ноутбуков у AMD тоже есть поводы для гордости. На основе процессоров семейства Ryzen AI 300 партнёры компании предлагают около 150 моделей ноутбуков, что примерно в два раза больше, чем у конкурирующей платформы Intel. По мнению представительницы AMD, её компания предлагает в сегменте ноутбуков лучшие центральные процессоры, лучшие графические процессоры и лучшие нейронные процессоры (NPU).\nКроме того, AMD недавно удалось заручиться поддержкой компании Dell Technologies, которая до этого её продукцию в своих готовых ПК не использовала. По прогнозам Джин Ху, компания AMD продолжит укреплять свои рыночные позиции в обозримом будущем. В корпоративном сегменте, например, продажи растут на протяжении шести кварталов подряд. Клиенты, покупающие процессоры EPYC, ценят в них низкое энергопотребление и невысокую совокупную стоимость владения, помимо прочего.\nУкажите имя пользователя:\n© 1997—2025 Электронное периодическое издание \"3ДНьюс\" | Свидетельство о регистрации СМИ Эл ФС 77-22224\nвыдано Федеральной Службой по надзору за соблюдением законодательства в сфере массовых коммуникаций и охране культурного наследия\nПри цитировании документа ссылка на сайт с указанием автора обязательна.

            "full_content": "Updated on:  March 7, 2025 / 1:55 PM EST\n          / CBS News\n        \nThe Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and ongoing crackdown on immigration are likely to result in higher prices for American consumers and businesses, according to Wall Street analysts.\nEconomists with Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on Friday that they expect inflation in 2025 to rise 2.5%, up from their previous forecast in December of 2.3%. Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast. \n\"We now see higher inflation in 2025 with a more pronounced and sooner re-acceleration in goods prices,\" the analysts wrote.\n\"If our narrative entering the year was 'slower growth, stickier inflation' then we now think 'slower growth, firmer inflation,'\" they added.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs also said on Friday they're now projecting higher inflation, largely due to Mr. Trump's tariffs. Core PCE inflation, or price increases excluding food and energy costs, could rise to 3% this year, rather than sinking to 2.1% by year-end if there were no tariffs in place.\nThe cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the soaring cost of eggs becoming a national talking point. A recent CBS News poll found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation. \nInflation during the pandemic soared to its highest level since 1981, peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. The pace of price increases has cooled since then, but costs remain roughly 10% higher than before the COVID crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data shows. \nRecently, inflation has been moving in the wrong direction. After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% — higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12. \nMany businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.\nPresident Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.\nAlthough the delays leave open the possibility of a breakthrough in trade talks, the whipsaw in policy makes it more challenging for businesses to plan in advance. \nTighter immigration restrictions can contribute to inflation by reducing the nation's supply of labor, according to economists.\n\"One factor that we think limits services disinflation is reduced immigration, which could lead to labor shortages in many face-to-face service sectors (retail, restaurants, leisure, hospitals) that could result in supply-side driven inflation,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report. \nPersistent inflation could deter the Fed from moving to nudge down interest rates and lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, experts note. About 1 in 10 economists polled by FactSet expect the central bak to cut rates at its next meeting on March 19. \nAlain Sherter is a senior managing editor with CBS News.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk said Wednesday that he wants to privatize the U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak, according to reports from multiple news outlets. And as the most powerful oligarch in the U.S.âa man who’s been given the chance to unilaterally dismantle whatever he likes under the guise of a pseudo-government agency called DOGEâthe billionaire may get his wish soon.\n“I think logically we should privatize anything that can reasonably be privatized,” Musk said, according to Reuters. “I think we should privatize the Post Office and Amtrak, for example… We should privatize everything we possibly can.”\nMusk made the remarks Wednesday teleconferencing into the Morgan Stanley TMT conference in San Francisco, which was not open to the press. The billionaire complained about U.S. rail service without actually providing valuable context, like the fact that he’s fought against high-speed rail in California and, as the owner of a car company, has a vested interest in killing mass transit in the United States.\n“If youâre coming from another country, please donât use our national rail. It can leave you with a very bad impression of America,” Musk said, according to NBC News. “So, I just, I think we should prioritize anything that can be privatized.”\nMusk pitched an idea called the Hyperloop in 2013 with the purpose of derailing California’s publicly funded high-speed rail project, according to Ashlee Vance’s biography of the billionaire. And President Trump even said last month that he’d investigate the project for being poorly managed. So it makes sense that Musk and Trump would be opposed to anything funded by the government unless they get a cut. That’s how oligarchies work.\nMusk spent the rest of Wednesday on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., where he was reportedly chatting with some Republicans who were giving him an earful about how he needed to let Congress handle appropriations. Musk reassured Republicans that he would try to restore any funding for pet projects, according to the Washington Post, but that’s not how any of this is supposed to work. Congress rather famously has the power of the purse, deciding what gets funded and what gets cut, but Musk has made himself the ultimate arbiter of the government’s funding apparatus, despite having no authority to do so.\nMusk told a group of Republican senators in a closed-door lunch that he wanted to set up a direct line for them when they have questions, allowing them to get a near-instant response to their concerns, senators said. Some senators were given Muskâs phone number during Wednesdayâs meeting, and the entrepreneur said he would âcreate a system where members of Congress can call some central groupâ to get problematic cuts reversed quickly, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said.\nMusk doesn’t get to unilaterally cut whatever he wants and then divvy out dispensations for politically connected people who have his number. That’s not legal, and that’s not right. But it is the state of affairs right now as Musk slashes his way through the federal government, destroying anything he doesn’t personally profit from. Musk’s companies, like SpaceX, have lucrative contracts with the Department of Defense, but there’s no reporting that suggests anything that the billionaire controls will see funding disappear. Cancer research and hundreds of thousands of federal employees, on the other hand, are disposable in Musk’s eyes.\nThe U.S. Postal Service may be on the chopping block, but its existence is literally mandated in the U.S. Constitution. Known as the Postal Clause, it gives Congress the sole authority to “establish post offices and post roads.” If Musk wants to privatize it, they can certainly try, but it wouldn’t be legal by any normal historical interpretation of the Constitution.\nCritics of the Postal Service claim the agency “loses” money, but that same logic could be applied to literally any government service, from public schools to roads. The U.S. highway system costs money, but part of living in a modern society is having roads that people can drive on, which itself drives economic activity just as having a functional postal system does.\nAnd while plenty of internet commentators point out that companies like Amazon rely on the postal service for their so-called last mile of deliveries, the privatization of mail would hypothetically allow a company like Amazon to profit even further by gaining government contracts. Much like how SpaceX gets government money to perform services previously done by NASA, delivery companies (including Amazon’s own, which has grown dramatically in recent years) would profit handsomely from privatization.\nBut Amtrak and the Postal Service are just two parts of a much larger dismantling currently underway. News broke late Wednesday that Trump was planning to sign an executive order soon that would abolish the Department of Education, according to the Wall Street Journal, yet another thing that can’t be legally accomplished without a vote in Congress. But there’s no sign that Trump or Musk plan to respect the rule of law anytime soon.\n\nAmazonAmtrakDOGEDonald TrumpElon MuskU.S. Postal ServiceUSPS \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The nation's space agency is cutting costs at the behest of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as part of the Trump administration's slashing of science funding.\n        \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Segui tutte le inchieste del Fatto Quotidiano\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUltimo aggiornamento: 10:44 del 13 Marzo\t\t\t\t\t\t\nL’Italia è il mercato europeo più attrattivo per l’industria del gioco d’azzardo. Lo dice Morgan Stanley nel suo ultimo rapporto; lo dicono i numeri: 15,4 miliardi di proventi lordi nel 2024, più di qualsiasi altro paese europeo. Ma evidentemente secondo i nostri politicanti (i politici sono cosa diversa) questo non è sufficiente: occorre aiutare chi specula sul gioco, anche perché così si rimpinguano le casse dello Stato. È così che il governo, mascherandosi dietro la battaglia al gioco illegale, ha eliminato il divieto di pubblicità delle scommesse a suo tempo introdotto dal Decreto Balduzzi e bandiera del M5S (il presidente della Lazio e senatore di Forza Italia Claudio Lotito ci aveva già provato due volte, prima con un emendamento al milleproroghe nel gennaio 2023, e l’anno scorso con un emendamento al Ddl fisco). M5S che – unico partito – continua a contrastare l’operazione. \nAnche se, diciamo la verità, i vari governi succedutisi nel tempo hanno tollerato l’aggiramento del divieto, dimodoché basta guardare una partita di calcio o leggere un quotidiano sportivo per essere informati sulle quote di eventi sportivi, e di conseguenza essere sottoposti a pubblicità implicita. E l’Inter ha addirittura come sponsor Betsson, che è una società di gioco d’azzardo online. Ma c’è un’altra modalità di elusione del divieto pubblicitario, meno visibile ma altrettanto dannosa, ed essa consiste nella strategia del cross-selling, pratica attraverso la quale gli operatori possono indirizzare i giocatori della rete fisica di vendita e della lotteria verso altri prodotti di gioco d’azzardo – come giochi online e scommesse sportive – che sono più remunerativi per i concessionari. Oltre che più dannosi per i giocatori. Infatti, secondo dati recenti, nel mercato italiano le perdite medie nelle scommesse sportive sono quasi il doppio di quelle della lotteria, mentre le perdite medie nei casinò online sono quasi quattro volte tanto. Questa dinamica si riflette nel costante ed esponenziale aumento delle perdite dei giocatori, che sono lievitate nel 2024 del 180% rispetto all’anno precedente.\nSisal (che è controllata dall’irlandese Flutter Entertainment, principale operatore di scommesse sportive online e iGaming al mondo) è maestra in tale strategia, che ha applicato con successo con il SuperEnalotto, la cui concessione si aggiudicò nel 2019 con un’offerta che sbaragliò il campo dei concorrenti: 222 milioni di euro a fronte di Lottomatica che offrì 130 milioni salvo poi rinegoziare i termini con il governo e imporre una tassa occulta sui tabaccai sfruttando la sua posizione dominante, pratica per la quale Sisal è stata condannata dal Tribunale di Milano.\nMa le operazioni di acquisizione di Flutter Entertainment non si fermano qui perché nell’autunno scorso ha annunciato l’acquisizione di Snaitech (Snai), che è il terzo operatore online nel mercato italiano con una quota del 9,9% nel 2023 e 291.000 giocatori medi mensili. Costo dell’operazione? 2,3 miliardi di euro! Ma non è ancora finita perché lo stesso colosso del gioco mira ad aggiudicarsi anche la gara per la concessione del Lotto, gara che è in scadenza il giorno 17 di questo mese. Flutter Entertainment ha dichiarato ad investitori internazionali che il cross-selling è alla base della sua strategia di espansione in Italia, Lotto compreso.\nMorgan Stanley lo dice chiaramente nel suo ultimo rapporto sul mercato gioco d’azzardo in Italia: il cross-selling di Sisal è la ragione principale per ulteriori investimenti di Flutter Entertainment nelle lotterie. Secondo gli addetti ai lavori Sisal potrebbe replicare lo stesso approccio adottato durante l’ultima concessione del SuperEnalotto per aggiudicarsi il Lotto, e fare un’offerta molto aggressiva che sbaragli la concorrenza. In conclusione, Sisal vuole aggiudicarsi il Lotto per continuare a far crescere i suoi business di scommesse sportive e giochi online, che sono il suo core business.\nQuesta preoccupazione è stata espressa anche dalla società civile: la Campagna nazionale contro i rischi del gioco d’azzardo ha di recente lanciato un appello al prossimo vincitore del Lotto ad astenersi dalla pratica del cross-selling. Difficile credere che il governo Meloni avrà voglia di vigilare. Anche perché con più gente che si rovina più lo Stato guadagna.\nRiceviamo e pubblichiamo la seguente rettifica da Sisal Italia spa\nSi osserva che sono totalmente false sia la notizia che SISAL abbia rinegoziato con l’Agenzia dei Monopoli e delle Dogane i termini della concessione dei “Giochi Numerici a Totalizzatore Nazionale” (tra i quali il SuperEnalotto) sia la presunta imposizione di quella che viene definita, dall’autore dell’articolo, una “tassa occulta sui tabaccai”. A tale riguardo si rileva che l’offerta in gara di SISAL era risultata già vincente dal punto di vista tecnico (45 punti rispetto ai 42,80 del secondo) ed è poi risultata vincente anche dal punto di vista economico. Tale offerta comprendeva già la possibilità di offrire servizi opzionali a pagamento ai punti vendita e, quindi, non si trattava affatto di una “tassa occulta”. Peraltro, tali servizi a pagamento (che includono sia servizi per il punto vendita che la disponibilità di altri prodotti per il pubblico) sono sempre stati opzionali, lasciando libera scelta al ricevitore se sottoscriverli o meno (tanto che sono presenti solo su una parte dei punti vendita).\nInoltre, la citata pronuncia del Tribunale di Milano, che è ancora sub judice in quanto oggetto di appello, non ha attinenza con la liceità dell’offerta di SISAL; essa ha riguardato il recesso di un solo punto vendita (su 34.000), senza tuttavia che la condanna comprendesse l’obbligo di riattivare il rapporto con il medesimo, evidenziando che non era stata dimostrata in corso di causa la natura “ritorsiva” del recesso e ribandendo che “del tutto legittimamente la concessionaria convenuta avrebbe potuto decidere di non concludere un nuovo contratto” con l’esercente. L’esposizione di tale fatto, così come incidentalmente inserita nell’articolo, è chiaramente contraria alla deontologia professionale giornalistica in quanto lascia intendere che SISAL sia stata sanzionata per la proposizione di tali servizi, quando, in concreto non è così.\nPrendo atto della replica di Sisal, ma preciso che mi sono limitato a riportare dati di fatto. In particolare, la sentenza del Tribunale di Milano del 2023 ha accertato che il recesso di Sisal da un contratto per SuperEnalotto, per la mancata adesione dell’esercente al pacchetto suppletivo MySisal, ha configurato un abuso di potere e arrecato un danno all’esercente stesso. Apprendo solo ora che la sentenza sarebbe stata appellata. Aspettiamo l’esito del giudizio di secondo grado.\n\nIl responsabile dell'organizzazione del partito di Meloni e vicepresidente del Copasir ha aggiunto di non avere intenzione di “mettersi a discutere: ne parleremo in tribunale”.

(Adnkronos) - Con il piano industriale 2024-2028, che prevedono nei cinque anni investimenti per 17,7 miliardi di euro (+7%), Terna conferma gli obiettivi strategici, per adempiere al suo ruolo di Transmission System Operator nazionale. Al centro della strategia per la transizione e l’indipendenza energetica: lo sviluppo infrastrutturale sostenibile, l’integrazione delle rinnovabili e dei sistemi di accumulo, le interconnessioni con l’estero. Il gruppo guidato dall'ad Giuseppina Di Foggia, infatti, dovrà abilitare l’integrazione della nuova capacità di generazione rinnovabile attraverso l’espansione dell’infrastruttura di rete, da pianificare e realizzare insieme allo sviluppo dei sistemi di accumulo e all’incremento dell’adeguatezza del sistema elettrico. Sarà inoltre necessario favorire una maggiore  indipendenza energetica del sistema elettrico nazionale. La capacità rinnovabile che verrà installata nei prossimi anni ha infatti anche l’obiettivo di ridurre la dipendenza italiana dalle commodities importate da paesi stranieri. \nSolo la massima integrazione delle rinnovabili e la più efficiente gestione  dei flussi di energia, sottolinea Terna, potranno infatti garantire all’Italia un futuro energetico più sicuro e indipendente,  con una diminuzione della volatilità dei prezzi per l’utente finale. Terna dovrà anche garantire il servizio di trasmissione dell’energia al Paese, con standard di  assoluta qualità in uno scenario sempre più mutevole, nonché assicurare il più elevato livello di  sicurezza della rete di trasmissione, sia in termini di protezione degli asset fisici sia di cybersecurity, introducendo innovative soluzioni digitali e tecnologiche per far fronte a nuove sfide. Un obiettivo  fondamentale sarà, infine, quello legato all’incremento della resilienza delle infrastrutture, di fronte  all’intensificarsi della frequenza di eventi meteorologici estremi.\nPur mantenendo inalterate le linee strategiche di fondo, l’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024- 2028 rafforza il concetto di Duplice Transizione - Energetica e Digitale, necessaria a garantire una  Just Transition equa e inclusiva per tutti gli stakeholders. Nell’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028, la sostenibilità degli investimenti, sottolinea ancora il gruppo, si conferma  elemento essenziale per la creazione di valore per l’azienda e per il sistema nel suo complesso.  Oltre il 99% degli interventi di Terna, infatti, è considerato sostenibile secondo i criteri di ammissibilità  introdotti dalla Tassonomia Europea.\nLe attività di sviluppo del Gruppo Terna continueranno a essere focalizzate lungo due direttrici  strategiche: Attività Regolate in Italia e Attività Non Regolate. Le attività regolate in Italia continueranno a rappresentare il core business del Gruppo. Terna prevede di investire 16,6 miliardi di euro complessivi nel quinquennio 2024-2028 per sviluppare e  ammodernare la rete di trasmissione elettrica nazionale. Si tratta del Piano di investimenti regolati  più alto di sempre per Terna con un incremento del 7% rispetto al precedente Piano.\nTerna ha registrato un deciso avanzamento nell’execution dei principali progetti che hanno mostrat  importanti progressi negli ultimi 12 mesi in termini di autorizzazioni e catena di fornitura: circa il 90%  dei progetti di investimento è stato autorizzato dalle Autorità competenti (rispetto al 79% di marzo  2024) e circa l’80% di essi è coperto da contratti di approvvigionamento (rispetto al 70% di marzo  2024).\nNell’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028, Terna prevede di investire complessivamente 10,8 miliardi di euro in cinque anni per lo sviluppo della rete elettrica di trasmissione nazionale. Il 14 marzo 2025, Terna ha presentato il Piano di Sviluppo 2025-2034 che prevede oltre 23 miliardi di euro di investimenti in un orizzonte temporale di dieci anni (+10% rispetto al precedente Piano  decennale 2023-2032). Terna investirà 3,6 miliardi di euro per le attività di rinnovo ed efficienza degli asset, rispetto ai circa  2,9 miliardi di euro previsti nel precedente Piano. Gli investimenti di Terna per il Piano di Sicurezza salgono a 2,3 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai circa 1,7  miliardi di euro previsti nel precedente Piano. Grazie a tutti gli investimenti previsti, il valore degli asset regolati (Regulatory Asset Base, Rab) crescerà dai 22,5 miliardi di euro nel 2024 a circa 32 miliardi di euro nel 2028, con un tasso di crescita  annuo composto (Compound Annual Growth Rate, Cagr) del 9% circa nell’arco di Piano, in  miglioramento rispetto all’8% del precedente Piano. A fine 2025, la Rab sarà pari a 24,8 miliardi di  euro.\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - Terna ha chiuso il 2024 con ricavi pari a 3,680 miliardi di euro, registrano un aumento di 493,5 milioni di euro (+15,5%) rispetto al 2023. L'ebitda del 2024 si attesta a 2,566 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 397,8  milioni di euro rispetto al 2023 (+18,3%), per il miglior risultato delle Attività Regolate. L’Ebit, a valle di ammortamenti e svalutazioni pari a 889,0 milioni  di euro, si attesta a 1.677,4 milioni di euro, rispetto ai 1.362,3 milioni di euro del 2023 (+23,1%). L’utile netto di gruppo dell’esercizio è pari a 1,061 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 176,5 milioni di  euro (+19,9%) rispetto agli 885,4 milioni di euro del 2023. Lo rende noto il gruppo dopo che il Cda, riunitosi oggi sotto la presidenza di Igor De Biasio, ha esaminato e approvato l’Aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028 e i risultati al 31 dicembre 2024 del Gruppo, presentati dall’Amministratore Delegato e Direttore Generale Giuseppina Di Foggia.\nLa situazione patrimoniale consolidata registra un patrimonio netto di Gruppo pari a 7.524,2 milioni di euro, a fronte dei 6.324,4 milioni di euro al 31 dicembre 2023. Gli investimenti complessivi effettuati dal Gruppo Terna nell’esercizio sono stati pari a 2.692,1 milioni  di euro, in forte crescita (+17,6%) rispetto ai 2.290,0 milioni di euro del 2023. Tra i principali progetti  dell’esercizio si segnalano gli avanzamenti del Tyrrhenian Link, il collegamento elettrico sottomarino fra Campania, Sicilia e Sardegna nel cui Ramo Est, quello fra Campania e Sicilia, è stata avviata nei  primi mesi del 2025 la prima fase della posa del cavo sottomarino. A ciò si aggiungono gli  avanzamenti dell’Adriatic Link, l’elettrodotto sottomarino fra Abruzzo e Marche e del collegamento  tra la Toscana, la Corsica e la Sardegna (Sa.Co.I.3), nonché gli interventi per incrementare la  sicurezza e l’efficienza della rete elettrica in alta e altissima tensione nelle aree interessate dai Giochi Olimpici e Paralimpici ‘Milano-Cortina 2026’, quelli per accrescere la capacità di scambio fra la  Calabria e la Sicilia (collegamento Bolano-Annunziata), fra le diverse zone del mercato elettrico in  Sicilia (collegamento Paternò-Pantano-Priolo) e le attività realizzative dei collegamenti ColungaCalenzano, fra Emilia-Romagna e Toscana, e Cassano-Chiari, in Lombardia.\nPer finanziare la significativa crescita degli investimenti a sostegno dello sviluppo di un sistema  elettrico ancora più efficiente, resiliente e digitale, che garantisca la sicurezza energetica del Paese,  l'indebitamento finanziario netto al 31 dicembre 2024 si è attestato a 11.160,4 mln di euro, rispetto ai 10.494,3 mln di euro a fine 2023. L’incremento dell’indebitamento finanziario netto è mitigato dall’emissione obbligazionaria ibrida lanciata il 4 aprile 2024 per un importo di 850 milioni di euro, contabilizzata come strumento di equity.   Nel corso del 2024, grazie all’ampliamento della base asset regolata (Rab) e all’aggiornamento del  Wacc (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) riconosciuto per l’anno, i ricavi delle Attività Regolate sono cresciuti a 3.096,2 mln di euro (2.669,8 mln nel 2023, +16%). Nel 2024, i ricavi delle Attività Non Regolate sono significativamente cresciuti a 584 mln, registrando un +13% rispetto ai 516,8 mln di euro del 2023.\nPer il 2025 è previsto che il gruppo Terna possa conseguire ricavi per 4,03 miliardi di euro, un Ebitda pari a 2,70 miliardi di euro e un utile netto di gruppo pari a 1,08 miliardi di euro. Con specifico riferimento al Piano Investimenti il Gruppo ha un target 2025 pari a circa 3,4 miliardi di euro. Tali obiettivi saranno perseguiti mantenendo l’impegno alla massimizzazione della generazione di cassa necessaria ad assicurare una sana ed equilibrata struttura finanziaria. \nLa nuova politica dei dividendi introduce un livello minimo (floor) pari al dividendo 2024 (39,62 centesimi di euro per azione) per l’intero arco di Piano Industriale 2024-28 Update, con l’obiettivo di garantire agli azionisti una remunerazione interessante e solida. Lo rende noto Terna in un comunicato precisando che la nuova politica prevede, nell’arco di Piano, la distribuzione di un dividendo pari al maggiore tra il valore del dividendo per azione (Dividend Per Share, Dps) 2024 (39,62 centesimi di euro per azione) e una crescita annua del dividendo per azione pari al 4%, assumendo il 2023 come anno di riferimento (33,96 centesimi di euro per azione).\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - I ricavi di gruppo nel 2028 sono previsti in crescita a 5,19 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai 4,60 miliardi di euro del precedente piano, e l’Ebitda a 3,36 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai 3,25 miliardi di euro del  precedente Piano. La crescita media annua (Cagr) nell’arco di Piano sarà di circa il 9% per l’Ebitda. Nel 2025, in particolare, è previsto che i ricavi si attestino a 4,03 miliardi di euro e l’Ebitda a 2,70 miliardi di euro. La crescita dei risultati operativi si rifletterà anche sull’utile netto di Gruppo che passerà da 1,08 miliardi di euro nel 2025 a 1,19 miliardi di euro nel 2028 (rispetto a 1,10 miliardi di euro previsto al  2028 dal precedente Piano). Lo rende noto Terna in un comunicato dopo che il Cda, che si è riunito oggi sotto la presidenza di Igor De Biasio, ha esaminato e approvato l’Aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028 e i risultati al 31 dicembre 2024 del Gruppo, presentati dall’Amministratore Delegato e Direttore Generale Giuseppina Di Foggia.\nIl Consiglio di Amministrazione di Terna proporrà all’Assemblea degli azionisti l’approvazione di un dividendo complessivo per l’esercizio 2024 di 796.358.830,40 euro pari a 39,62 centesimi di euro per azione e la distribuzione al netto dell’acconto sul dividendo ordinario relativo all'esercizio 2024 pari a 11,92 centesimi di euro per azione già posto in pagamento dal 20 novembre 2024 - dei rimanenti 27,70 centesimi di euro per azione, al lordo delle eventuali ritenute di legge, da mettere in pagamento dal 25 giugno 2025 con 'data stacco' 23 giugno 2025 della cedola n. 42. A tale saldo non concorrono le azioni proprie che risulteranno in portafoglio alla 'record date' precedentemente indicata. L’ammontare del saldo del dividendo dell’esercizio 2024 spettante alle azioni proprie detenute dalla società alla 'record date' sarà destinato alla riserva denominata 'utili portati a nuovo'. \nRoma, 25 mar.

Una \"iniziativa personale\" sulla quale \"non impegno il gruppo\", ha specificato spiegando di vedere la cosa come una sorta di \"risarcimento per una ingiustizia secolare\". Quella appunto del cognome 'ereditato' soltanto dal padre. \nAttualmente in Senato sono in discussione alcune proposte in commissione Giustizia proprio sul tema del cognome. \"Anziché creare infiniti problemi con la gestione dei doppi cognomi -la proposta Franceschini- stabiliamo che dalla nuova legge prenderanno il solo il cognome della madre. E’ una cosa semplice ed anche un risarcimento per una ingiustizia secolare che ha avuto non solo un valore simbolico ma è stata una delle fonti culturali delle disuguaglianze di genere\". Una 'cosa semplice', argomenta l'ex-ministro tuttavia capace di creare polemiche. Critico il centrodestra, perplessità nei 5 Stelle e anche nello stesso Pd tra cattolici e chi, off the records, avrebbe preferito tenere i riflettori accesi oggi tra il pasticcio Irpef del governo e la questione salari italiani 'certificati' dell'Oil come i più bassi tra tutti i Paesi del G20. Tema su cui è intervenuta con nettezza la segretaria Elly Schlein: \"Ultimi senza appello e il governo Meloni non ha mosso un dito\" nè sul versante contratti nè sulla proposta del salario minimo. \nE' la maggioranza a evidenziare il 'gap' tra l'attualità e il tema sollevato da Franceschini. Scrive Matteo Salvini sui social: \"Ecco le grandi priorità della sinistra italiana: invece del doppio cognome, togliere ai bimbi il cognome del padre! Ma certo, cancelliamoli dalla faccia della terra questi papà, così risolviamo tutti i problemi… Ma dove le pensano ste idee geniali?\". E Carlo Calenda si domanda: \"Altre priorità non ne abbiamo? Boh\". \nDiversi esponenti Pd fanno invece sponda con l'ex-ministrom da Laura Boldrini a Valeria Valente e Anna Rossomando che è relatrice per i dem della legge sul doppio cognome: \"Oggi finalmente una voce maschile ha riscontrato che per secoli c'è stata una sorta di invisibilità delle donne, con l'attribuzione del solo cognome del padre\", dice Rossomando. Condivide anche Luana Zanella di Avs anche se ammette che il ddl avrebbe vita difficile: \"E' una proposta interessante e condivisibile, sicuramente guarda molto in là. Vista la difficoltà che abbiamo avuto a far passare il doppio cognome, quello materno e paterno, possiamo immaginare il percorso faticoso di questa proposta. n ogni caso valuterò se presentarla anche alla Camera\". \nMentre Stefano Lepri, cattolico e membro della Direzione Pd, non condivide la proposta di Franceschini: \"Il cognome del padre attribuito ai figli non è un retaggio superato del patriarcato, bensì il primo modo per evitare che l'uomo si limiti alla sua funzione riproduttiva, lasciando interamente alla donna il compito di mantenere e crescere la prole. Le varie proposte sul cognome dei figli non possono dimenticare l'importanza cruciale di responsabilizzare i maschi - pubblicamente e fin dalla nascita - nel loro dovere di essere davvero padri\". \nE per il costituzionalista Cesare Mirabelli, il ddl avrebbe vita difficile anche dal punto di costituzionale. \"Si presta alle stesse censure di illegittimità che riguardavano l'obbligo di trasmettere ai figli solo il cognome paterno. Una diseguaglianza -dice all'Adnkronos- non si sana capovolgendola e introducendone un'altra. Il ddl Franceschini sarà criticabile ed impugnabile per illegittimità costituzionale se mai dovesse arrivare al traguardo. Ma io credo che probabilmente già nell'iter legislativo dopo che la Commissione Affari costituzionali ne valuterà la costituzionalità in chiave politica, il ddl sarà bloccato. Non arriverà in Aula\". \nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - Nei cinque anni di Piano gli investimenti di Terna salgono a complessivi 17,7 miliardi  di euro (+7%, pari a 1,2 miliardi di euro in più nello stesso arco temporale). Lo rende noto il gruppo dopo che il Cda,  riunitosi oggi sotto la presidenza di Igor De Biasio, ha esaminato e approvato l’Aggiornamento del Piano Industriale  2024-2028 e i risultati al 31 dicembre 2024 del Gruppo, presentati dall’Amministratore Delegato e  Direttore Generale Giuseppina Di Foggia.\nInoltre, dei 17,7 miliardi di euro di investimenti complessivi di Gruppo nel periodo 2024-2028, Terna prevede di investire 3,4 miliardi di euro nel 2025. Nonostante l’accelerazione degli investimenti, Terna conferma \"l’impegno a mantenere una solida e  sostenibile struttura del capitale, anche attraverso l’emissione di ulteriori strumenti ibridi. Il costo medio del debito netto di Piano è previsto pari a 3,1%, in miglioramento rispetto al 3,3% previsto nel precedente Piano\".\nTerna ha chiuso il 2024 con ricavi pari a 3,680 miliardi di euro, registrano un aumento di 493,5 milioni di euro (+15,5%) rispetto al 2023. L'ebitda del 2024 si attesta a 2,566 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 397,8 milioni di euro rispetto al 2023 (+18,3%), per il miglior risultato delle Attività Regolate. L’Ebit, a valle di ammortamenti e svalutazioni pari a 889,0 milioni di euro, si attesta a 1.677,4 milioni di euro, rispetto ai 1.362,3 milioni di euro del 2023 (+23,1%). L’utile netto di gruppo dell’esercizio è pari a 1,061 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 176,5 milioni di euro (+19,9%) rispetto agli 885,4 milioni di euro del 2023. \nLa situazione patrimoniale consolidata registra un patrimonio netto di Gruppo pari a 7.524,2 milioni di euro, a fronte dei 6.324,4 milioni di euro al 31 dicembre 2023. Gli investimenti complessivi effettuati dal Gruppo Terna nell’esercizio sono stati pari a 2.692,1 milioni di euro, in forte crescita (+17,6%) rispetto ai 2.290,0 milioni di euro del 2023. Tra i principali progetti dell’esercizio si segnalano gli avanzamenti del Tyrrhenian Link, il collegamento elettrico sottomarino fra Campania, Sicilia e Sardegna nel cui Ramo Est, quello fra Campania e Sicilia, è stata avviata nei primi mesi del 2025 la prima fase della posa del cavo sottomarino. A ciò si aggiungono gli avanzamenti dell’Adriatic Link, l’elettrodotto sottomarino fra Abruzzo e Marche e del collegamento tra la Toscana, la Corsica e la Sardegna (Sa.Co.I.3), nonché gli interventi per incrementare la sicurezza e l’efficienza della rete elettrica in alta e altissima tensione nelle aree interessate dai Giochi Olimpici e Paralimpici ‘Milano-Cortina 2026’, quelli per accrescere la capacità di scambio fra la Calabria e la Sicilia (collegamento Bolano-Annunziata), fra le diverse zone del mercato elettrico in Sicilia (collegamento Paternò-Pantano-Priolo) e le attività realizzative dei collegamenti ColungaCalenzano, fra Emilia-Romagna e Toscana, e Cassano-Chiari, in Lombardia.\nPer finanziare la significativa crescita degli investimenti a sostegno dello sviluppo di un sistema elettrico ancora più efficiente, resiliente e digitale, che garantisca la sicurezza energetica del Paese, l'indebitamento finanziario netto al 31 dicembre 2024 si è attestato a 11.160,4 mln di euro, rispetto ai 10.494,3 mln di euro a fine 2023. L’incremento dell’indebitamento finanziario netto è mitigato dall’emissione obbligazionaria ibrida lanciata il 4 aprile 2024 per un importo di 850 milioni di euro, contabilizzata come strumento di equity. Nel corso del 2024, grazie all’ampliamento della base asset regolata (Rab) e all’aggiornamento del Wacc (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) riconosciuto per l’anno, i ricavi delle Attività Regolate sono cresciuti a 3.096,2 mln di euro (2.669,8 mln nel 2023, +16%). Nel 2024, i ricavi delle Attività Non Regolate sono significativamente cresciuti a 584 mln, registrando un +13% rispetto ai 516,8 mln di euro del 2023.\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - \"Vorrei riassumere in tre punti i capisaldi dell'aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028  presentato oggi: significativo incremento degli investimenti che, con 17,7 miliardi di euro in cinque anni, segnano un nuovo record per Terna; programmazione territoriale, per facilitare l’integrazione  delle fonti rinnovabili nella rete, che renderemo ancora più affidabile ed efficiente; rafforzamento del  ruolo del Gruppo al servizio della sicurezza elettrica e dell’indipendenza energetica del Paese\". Ad affermarlo è Giuseppina Di Foggia, l'amministratore delegato e direttore generale di Terna dopo che il Cda ha esaminato e approvato l'aggiornamento del piano industriale 2024-28.\n\"Puntiamo - aggiunge - su sostenibilità e digitalizzazione per realizzare infrastrutture fondamentali per la  decarbonizzazione del Paese, a ridotto impatto ambientale, e per gestire una rete più resiliente e  pronta ad affrontare le sfide del settore energetico\".\n\"Con i risultati ottenuti nel 2024, frutto del lavoro e della competenza delle nostre persone, continuiamo a creare valore per i nostri stakeholder e ci confermiamo come un gruppo sempre più solido nel panorama energetico nazionale, consapevoli della responsabilità che ci è stata affidata: abilitare la transizione energetica, garantendo i più alti livelli di qualità del servizio di trasmissione, al minor costo possibile per imprese e cittadini\". \n\"Grazie agli sforzi che stiamo facendo per sostenere la transizione energetica con maggiori investimenti nelle attività regolate e massimizzando i business nelle attività non regolate siamo in grado di migliorare i target di crescita dell'utile netto ad un media del 6% l'anno nel periodo di piano assicurando una stabilità finanziaria. Confidiamo di essere sulla strada giusta\".\n\"La nostra priorità strategica - sottolinea Di Foggia - è quella di guidare la transizione energetica verso le rinnovabili in Italia migliorando la qualità, la sicurezza e la resilienza della rete e riducendo al contempo molto la dipendenza del nostro sistema elettrico dalle commodities importate. Lo sviluppo delle rinnovabili e dello storage sostenuti dai contratti a lungo termine consentiranno una maggiore stabilità delle bollette elettriche per il consumatore finale\".\nGentile lettore, la pubblicazione dei commenti è sospesa dalle 20 alle 9, i commenti per ogni articolo saranno chiusi dopo 72 ore, il massimo di caratteri consentito per ogni messaggio è di 1.500 e ogni utente può postare al massimo 150 commenti alla settimana.

            "full_content": "The car company’s fortunes are riding on Elon Musk’s future.\nProduced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\nIt’s been a bad month for the stock market. But it’s been a terrible month—in fact, a terrible year—for Tesla. Even after rebounding since Monday, perhaps with some help from Donald Trump’s South Lawn salesmanship, Tesla’s stock price is down almost 40 percent since January 1.\nSome of that drop is down to concrete issues with Tesla’s core car business: Sales last year fell for the first time in more than a decade, and Wall Street analysts are now estimating that they will have fallen again in the most recent quarter. Tesla is facing fierce price competition in China, where its year-over-year sales fell by 49 percent in February, and steeply declining sales in Western Europe. Although the company has promised that it will be rolling out new, more affordable models later this year, details have been sparse at best.\nThe most important driver of Tesla’s share slump, however, can be summed up in two words: Elon Musk. Tesla has always been a “story stock,” which is to say the sort of investment whose price depends less on a company’s economic fundamentals and more on a story of what its future will be. Tesla’s problem right now is that the hero, and narrator, of its story has gone AWOL.\nInvestor expectations of what Tesla is going to achieve have certainly changed over time. In the past, investors were focused on Tesla’s potential to corner the global electric-vehicle market. Today, that ambition has receded, as competition—particularly from China—has intensified. Instead, investors now envision the company dominating the future market for self-driving cars and AI robotics. But the throughline of the Tesla story has always remained the same: the idea of Musk’s genius and ability to guide the company into the future. “It is almost impossible to separate Tesla, the company, from Musk,” the finance professor Aswath Damodaran has written previously. “What you believe about one will drive what you believe about the other.” And it’s because investors have bought into Musk’s over-the-top visions of Tesla’s future that, even now, the company’s shares trade at an outrageous price-to-earnings ratio, and its market cap is greater than that of the next nine biggest car companies combined.\nThe problem for Tesla at the moment is that investors’ faith in Musk has been shaken. His political activities—not only his work for the Trump administration but also his public support of the far-right AfD party in Germany—have led to a backlash against Tesla that certainly seems to have depressed sales in the United States and Europe. His mercurial social-media habits and goofy displays such as waving around a chain saw onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference are not reassuring to major investors. The reverse: A new Morgan Stanley investor survey found that 85 percent of respondents think that Musk’s political involvement is having “a negative or extremely negative impact on Tesla’s business fundamentals.”\nAside from all the noise, the simple reality is that Tesla now seems to be far down on the list of Musk’s priorities, behind DOGE, SpaceX, his new AI venture, and X. Musk is running a government agency, serving as the CEO of three companies, funding political campaigns, threatening politicians with potential primaries, and posting nonstop on social media. In the most literal sense, he just isn’t showing that much interest in building cars anymore. Since the beginning of the year, he has offered no real vision of how Tesla will deal with challenges such as the global rise of highly competitive EV manufacturers such as China’s BYD. In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he conceded that he was having “great difficulty” running all of his enterprises; about the best he could offer investors was a quote from a Monty Python movie: “Always look on the bright side of life.” Musk’s seeming indifference to the car business has become so noticeable that in a note to investors this week, the Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives—arguably the biggest Tesla bull on Wall Street—criticized him for “showing no attention to Tesla during this turbulent time.”\nThe appearance at the White House with Trump on Tuesday for what was effectively a car commercial seemed like an implicit recognition by Musk that he needs to change his ways (or at least pretend to do so). As Trump posed in a Tesla Model S that he said he was buying, Musk promised that the company would double its U.S. production over the next two years. Neither man has a great record of keeping promises, but the event was a sign that Musk was doing something to stop the bleeding. Some investors, at least, liked the story: By market close yesterday, Tesla’s stock was up more than 10 percent from its Monday low.\nWhether that will be enough to make up for the losses of the past four months is another question. Tesla investors are used to volatility; since 2018, the company’s stock price has fallen 40 percent or more on eight different occasions. And story stocks can bounce back quickly if they can recapture investors’ attention and belief. But that will require Musk to demonstrate more conviction and interest in the way he talks about, and runs, Tesla. Right now, he looks like a storyteller who’s lost the plot.\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation."

When he became CEO in 2017, Ricks’ annual compensation started at $15.8 million.\nIn that time, Eli Lilly has seen explosive growth, largely due to its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nBoth drugs belong to GLP-1 class of treatments, made famous by rival Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.58%) Ozempic.

            "full_content": "В своём годовом отчёте в конце прошлого месяца Nvidia уже отмечала, что доля Китая и Гонконга в структуре общей выручки компании по сравнению с предыдущим годом снизилась с 17 до 13 %, но сумма этой выручки всё равно выросла на 66 %. На этой неделе финансовый директор компании заявила, что из-за санкций США количество отгружаемых в Китай ускорителей Nvidia сократилось вдвое.\nДанные комментарии прозвучали из уст Колетт Кресс (Colette Kress) на технологической конференции Morgan Stanley. В текущем квартале, по её словам, объёмы поставок ускорителей Nvidia останутся примерно на таком уже уровне. Разработанные с учётом позапрошлогодних экспортных ограничений США ускорители H20 обеспечивают уровень быстродействия, позволяющий Nvidia конкурировать с китайскими разработчиками. Если опустить его ещё ниже, то поставки продукции Nvidia в Китай утратят особый смысл из-за роста конкуренции с китайскими игроками рынка, по словам Колетт Кресс. По сравнению с Blackwell, однако, H20 демонстрирует примерно в 25 раз более низкое быстродействие.\nКак резюмировала представительница Nvidia, «H20 будет поставляться так долго, как этого потребует спрос, и по мере соответствия актуальным требованиям экспортного контроля». Напомним, что в январе администрация Байдена успела ввести новые ограничения на поставку ускорителей вычислений за пределы США с более серьёзной географической градацией и усиленной системой лицензирования поставок. Поскольку эти требования вступят в силу не ранее мая текущего года, а у власти в США сейчас находится Дональд Трамп (Donald Trump), руководство Nvidia не считает разумным строить какие-либо прогнозы на тему дальнейшего влияния санкций на свой бизнес.\nУкажите имя пользователя:\n© 1997—2025 Электронное периодическое издание \"3ДНьюс\" | Свидетельство о регистрации СМИ Эл ФС 77-22224\nвыдано Федеральной Службой по надзору за соблюдением законодательства в сфере массовых коммуникаций и охране культурного наследия\nПри цитировании документа ссылка на сайт с указанием автора обязательна.

Der US-Risikokapitalgeber Morgan Stanley sagte für dieses Jahr ein \"schwächeres Wachstum\" voraus als zuvor erwartet.\nEin Handelskrieg mit den USA kommt den Chinesen gerade höchst ungelegen.\n                                    mehr\n\n\nDie von der US-Regierung verhängten Zölle lösten weltweit entschiedene Reaktionen aus - unter anderem in China. Die zweitgrößte Volkswirtschaft der Welt verhängte Zölle auf viele landwirtschaftliche Produkte aus den USA, die ab heute gelten. Betroffen ist etwa Hühnerfleisch, Mais und Getreide mit 15 Prozent. Ein Regierungssprecher in Peking sagte, Trumps jüngste Zölle \"gefährden die Sicherheit und Stabilität der globalen Lieferketten\".\nDieses Thema im Programm: Über dieses Thema berichtete Deutschlandfunk am 07.

            "full_content": "Despite the setback of this year’s wildfires, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be “out-of-control good” and credit for their success will be taken by Donald Trump, according to Endeavor and TKO exec Mark Shapiro.\n\n\tThe “L.A. and Back” narrative will drive strong interest in corporate hospitality packages offered by TKO’s On Location subsidiary, Shapiro predicted during an appearance at a Morgan Stanley media conference. Ben Swinburne, the Morgan Stanley analyst moderating Monday’s session with Shapiro, asked the exec if he felt “bullish” about L.A. in 2028 and anticipated that they will “go on as planned” despite the fires.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“They’ve had time to rebuild, and it’s going to be a coming-out party,” Shapiro said.  “Sort of at the other end of the spectrum from where the Oscars were last night when they celebrated L.A. and the pageantry and the history and, of course, encouraged folks to give back and support the rebuild.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tShapiro then made a sharp turn as he continued to paint the picture, getting political without any prompting. “President Trump is going to walk out of office with the trophy that is the L.A. Olympics, that ‘I did it, I brought it back, I was behind it, I put the resources, the support,'” the exec said. “He’ll be sitting front and center. I’m a true believer that this will be his Olympics as much as anything else.”\n\nRELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\n\tShapiro made the forecast without indicating explicitly whether the victory lap would be justified, but numerous ties exist between his businesses and the Trump administration. Endeavor and its CEO, Ari Emanuel, represented the president during his multi-year run as host of NBC’s The Apprentice franchise, which gave him enough visibility and resources to later enter politics. Vice President JD Vance was a client of Endeavor’s WME when he published his bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy, which would catapult him to elected office. More recently, Emanuel has affiliated himself with Elon Musk, a major Trump backer during the 2024 campaign who has become a close adviser to the president. Dana White, head of the TKO-owned UFC, also has been connected with Trump through the years.\n\n\tA former top exec at ESPN and Dick Clark Productions, Shapiro joined Endeavor in 2014. TKO, which is majority-owned by Endeavor and run by Emanuel, Shapiro and other Endeavor execs, was formed in 2023 from the merger of WWE and the UFC.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED: Endeavor’s On Location Looks To Milan-Cortina & L.A. Olympics After Star-Studded Paris Debut As Exclusive Hospitality Provider\n\n\tThe Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 already are putting experiences up for sale, Shapiro said. “Between Milan and L.A., we’re projecting to do $2 billion in revenue and $130 million in adjusted EBITDA. So it will be a good story.”\n\n\tOn Location was acquired by TKO from Endeavor along with two other former Endeavor assets, the Professional Bull Riders and IMG, for $3.2 billion. The transaction, which closed Friday, will position TKO as “pure sports” and Endeavor as “pure representation,” Shapiro said. As TKO continues its successful run as a publicly traded company, Endeavor is set to exit the public stage in the next few weeks as Silver Lake takes it private.\n\n\tAfter Shapiro mentioned Trump and then added that the Paris Olympics also were lucrative despite the “French being difficult,” Swinburne said he felt tempted to explore the Olympics topic in more detail but opted to move on.\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

            "full_content": "Компания OpenAI заключила соглашение по использованию облачной инфраструктуры CoreWeave для обучения и развёртывания передовых ИИ-моделей. Контракт подписан на пять лет, а его стоимость составляет $11,9 млрд. При этом OpenAI продолжит размещать нагрузки на облачной платформе Azure, поддерживая партнёрские отношения с Microsoft как минимум до 2030 года.\nВ рамках соглашения CoreWeave предоставит OpenAI высокопроизводительную инфраструктуру ИИ. В облаке CoreWeave применяются различные карты NVIDIA, включая суперускорители NVIDIA GB200 NVL72. В общей сложности CoreWeave закупила более 250 тыс. ИИ-ускорителей NVIDIA, в том числе H100 и H200.\nИсточник изображения: CoreWeave\nПо условиям подписанного договора, OpenAI получит долю в CoreWeave в виде ценных бумаг стоимостью $350 млн. Сама CoreWeave недавно подала заявку на первичное публичное размещение акций (IPO) на бирже Nasdaq. Процедура будет проведена при участии Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase и Goldman Sachs, а CoreWeave, как ожидается, получит рыночную оценку более $35 млрд.\nНужно отметить, что вычислительные мощности у CoreWeave также арендует Microsoft: на эти цели редмондский гигант потратит почти $10 млрд в период с 2023 по 2030 год. В 2024 году на долю Microsoft пришлось 62 % выручки CoreWeave, которая выросла до $1,9 млрд. Кроме того, Microsoft арендует у Oracle ускорители для нужд OpenAI.\nТаким образом, как отмечает TechCrunch, конкуренция между компанией OpenAI и её инвестором Microsoft усиливается. Напряженность между сторонами растет на протяжении нескольких лет, поскольку OpenAI активно укрепляет позиции на мировом ИИ-рынке. В частности, OpenAI конкурирует с Microsoft за корпоративных клиентов."

            "full_content": "По итогам февраля оптовые продажи Tesla в Китае резко сократились, а местный гигант BYD вырвался вперёд на крупнейшем в мире рынке электромобилей. Глава компании Илон Маск (Elon Musk) сохраняет оптимизм, хотя акции Tesla за месяц потеряли в цене 28 % — впервые более чем за два года.\nИсточник изображения: tesla.com\nЗа февраль 2025 года Tesla продала в Китае 30 688 электромобилей — это на 49 % меньше, чем в прошлом феврале, гласит предварительная статистика Китайской ассоциации легковых автомобилей. Для сравнения, в январе Tesla отгрузила со своего завода в Шанхае 63 238 единиц, хотя это был традиционно непростой месяц из-за празднования китайского Нового года. Тем временем BYD в феврале продала более 318 000 электромобилей и гибридов или на 161 % больше в годовом исчислении. Розничные продажи служат индикатором потребительской активности, а отгрузки тесно связаны с производством.\nМинувший год в Китае выдался для Tesla непростым. Впервые с момента запуска массового производства в Шанхае в 2020 году компания зафиксировала падение годовых поставок с предприятия. Это отражает слабый мировой спрос и усиление местной конкуренции. В 2024 году Tesla продала по всему миру 1,79 млн электромобилей — это ниже показателей 2023 года и прогнозов аналитиков. BYD, которая ещё в 2022 году прекратила выпуск машин, работающих исключительно на ископаемом топливе, за 2024 год продала 1,76 млн «чистых» электромобилей, а вместе с гибридами она реализовала 4,25 млн транспортных средств. По итогам февраля оптовые продажи машин на новых источниках энергии в Китае выросли на 82 % в годовом выражении.\n\nОдним только Китаем проблемы Tesla больше не ограничиваются: за февраль акции компании подешевели на 28 %, и это самое резкое падение с декабря 2022 года. В понедельник они потеряли 3 % цены, а рыночная капитализация опустилась до $915 млрд. На публике Маск сохраняет оптимистический настрой: в минувшие выходные он допустил, что в ближайшие пять лет прибыль Tesla вырастет на 1000 % — его поддержала Morgan Stanley, назвавшая компанию своим фаворитом в сегменте американского автопрома. В ходе квартального отчёта стало известно о падении выручки Tesla от электромобилей на 8 % и операционного дохода — на 23 %. Эти результаты компания связала со снижением средней цены продажи по линейкам Model 3, Model Y, Model S и Model X. Не везёт компании и в Европе: за первые два месяца 2025 года количество новых регистраций Tesla во Франции и Скандинавии сократилось, а продажи в Германии за январь упали примерно на 60 % в годовом выражении.\nУкажите имя пользователя:\n© 1997—2025 Электронное периодическое издание \"3ДНьюс\" | Свидетельство о регистрации СМИ Эл ФС 77-22224\nвыдано Федеральной Службой по надзору за соблюдением законодательства в сфере массовых коммуникаций и охране культурного наследия\nПри цитировании документа ссылка на сайт с указанием автора обязательна.

            "full_content": "A Netflix anunciou na última quarta-feira (5) que vai aumentar em 11% seus investimentos em conteúdo em 2025. Com isso, a companhia deve gastar aproximadamente US$ 18 bilhões (R$ 103 bilhões) na produção de novas séries e filmes, bem como no licenciamento de produções feitas por terceiros.\nSegundo o CFO da companhia, Spencer Neumann, essa é uma tendência que a companhia pretende continuar seguindo nos próximos anos. Em uma participação na conferência Morgan Stanley Tech, Media & Telecom, o executivo explicou que o streaming pretende continuar uma estratégica agressiva de crescimento, que pode se intensificar no futuro.\nSegundo Neumann, os US$ 18 bilhões em investimentos da plataforma em nada representam o teto de quanto a empresa pode gastar nos próximos anos. Ele também explicou que o orçamento dedicado a novos projetos surge a partir de uma mistura de “arte e ciência” e leva em consideração questões como a receita esperada pela companhia — que costuma ser bastante previsível.\nO grande valor dedicado pela Netflix é resultado de sua crença de que ainda há muito espaço para ela crescer. O CFO afirma que o serviço está em somente 40% das TVs conectadas ao redor do mundo e atinge somente 6% do mercado em potencial, correspondendo a 10% do tempo que as pessoas dedicam ao consumo de entretenimento.\nEm outras palavras, por mais que a companhia seja grande no setor de streaming, ela acredita que ainda há um grande mercado consumidor que pode conquistar nos próximos anos. “Vemos a oportunidade para crescer em todos os lugares”, explicou Newmann. “É mais sobre, onde está a maior oportunidade para crescimento e gastos... queremos permanecer no modo crescimento versus no modo manutenção por o quanto for possível”.\nO executivo também afirmou que, atualmente, a Netflix possui em seu catálogo três das séries mais bem-sucedidas da atualidade: Stranger Things, Wandinha e Round 6. No entanto, a companhia não deve investir somente nas suas produções originais que vêm de mais de 50 países e também procura crescer nos segmentos de licenciamento e esportes ao vivo.\nO CFO da Netflix observou que, embora o YouTube também esteja crescendo como plataforma de vídeos, não vê o serviço como seu grande concorrente. Para ele, o streaming ainda tem a TV tradicional como seu principal rival, se diferenciando da plataforma do Google por “compartilhar os riscos econômicos e criativos com seus criadores”.\n“Acreditamos que somos a casa para os melhores criadores e contadores de história do planeta”, afirmou. O executivo também explicou que, embora os esportes ao vivo sejam de interesse para a companhia, no momento ela vai continuar fazendo investimentos mais pontuais na área — como a transmissão de eventos especiais, jogos da NFL e as lutas da WWE.\nAo mesmo tempo que aumenta seus investimentos, a Netflix também tem aprimorado seus rendimentos. Ela acredita que vai conseguir fechar o ano fiscal de 2025 com receitas entre US$ 43,5 bilhões e US$ 44,5 bilhões (um aumento anual de 11,5% a 14%), que vão ser conquistadas tanto com o aumento de assinantes em escala global quanto através de possíveis reajustes de preço em territórios estratégicos, como os Estados Unidos.\nComente nas redes sociais do Minha Série!

            "full_content": "For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders.\n\"My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list,\" he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. \"The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so.\"\nThis year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune.\n\"I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend,\" Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a \"counter-example\" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. \"I don't want people to get misguided by this meme.\"\nAcross tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of \"efficiency\" and \"intensity\" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder.\nWhile the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them.\nElon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics.\nMeta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the \"culturally neutered\" corporate world had gotten away from \"masculine energy.\" Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic.\nOther companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a \"country club\" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly.\nGoogle, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an \"efficiency drive.\" Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office \"at least every weekday.\" Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022.\nStartups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a \"pronounced shift\" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups.\nBetween performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI.\nMeta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment. Shopify did not respond to a request for comment.\nFor years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs.\nBy 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors.\nAs the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs.\nAlso that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new \"extremely hardcore\" vision and \"long hours at a high intensity.\" At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting.\nAs of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting.\n\"People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over,\" Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. \"It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over.\"\nBy the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time.\nLayoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc.\nEmployees told BI about the pressure across the industry to \"do more with less.\" \"There's lots of uncertainty,\" one longtime Amazon employee said, \"and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management.\"\nTech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls \"span of control,\" tracking the number of reports per manager.\nAmid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands.\nMeta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to \"raise the bar on performance management,\" as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo.\nGoogle also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what \"Googleyness\" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being \"mission first.\"\n\"There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,\" a longtime Google manager said.\n\"We're being asked to do more for less,\" said another current longtime Google employee.\nThat same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate \"gives them the green light to do it openly.\" Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, \"but now the masks are off,\" the person said.\nMicrosoft was once referred to as the tech industry's \"country club,\" meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant.\nOne longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the \"culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations\" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same.\nAt TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals \"unattainable.\"\nThe company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.\n\"You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble,\" a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. \"For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right.\"\nThe increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups.\nStartups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the \"valley of death,\" when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable.\nThe free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off.\n\"I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money,\" Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI.\nNow, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count.\n\"Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results,\" said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. \"There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory.\"\nCall it the Big Tech trickle-down effect.\n\"Founders aren't sugarcoating it,\" said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. \"I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real.\"\nHave a tip? Contact Ashley Stewart via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

            "full_content": "Donald Trump transformed the White House into a car dealership to save Elon Musk’s floundering Tesla stock—to keep him from defaulting on his massive loans. \nTrump took a shot at being a shady car salesman Tuesday during a press event for Tesla at the White House. The president posed for photos behind the wheel of a Tesla he apparently can’t drive with a grinning Musk, remarked with astonishment that “everything’s computer” in the futuristic vehicles, and even read from what appeared to be a sales pitch sheet listing prices for different Tesla models.  \nTrump’s desperate show of fealty toward the bouncing billionaire came after Tesla stock plummeted 15 percent Monday, drying up the very last drops of Musk’s postelection gains and costing him a whopping $29 billion. \nBut it seems Trump’s rather unpresidential measures to boost Tesla’s floundering stock could serve a greater purpose: keeping the not-so liquid Musk from defaulting on his loans. \nThe Washington Post reported in April 2022 that Musk had already used more than half of his more than 170 million Tesla shares as collateral to acquire loans, and planned to do so again to borrow more money to buy Twitter, now X. \nMusk acquired X for $44 billion in October 2022, borrowing roughly $13 billion from several banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Bank of America. Musk’s loans had been “hung” on those banks’ balance sheets for nearly two years, longer than some unsold deals from the 2008 financial crisis. \nReuters reported last month that interest in acquiring Musk’s debt increased after Trump secured the White House and Musk emerged as his number two. At the time, only $1.3 billion remained on the banks’ sheets. \nIn a 2024 SEC filing, Musk was listed as holding a whopping 238,441,261 shares of Tesla stock that were “pledged as collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness.” At the time, he held ​715,022,706 shares in total, according to the filing, meaning that roughly one third of Musk’s shares were serving as collateral for his loans. \nIt’s unclear exactly how much of Musk’s shares are held in collateral now. Musk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla stock, a roughly 12.8 percent stake in the company, according to Investopedia. The value of those shares, including those held as collateral, appears to be dropping every day he plays pretend as the unelected bureaucrat leading the Department of Government Efficiency. \nHere’s where Musk’s problem emerges: If the stock price goes low enough, the banks Musk borrowed from could force him to sell his shares. \nTesla warned that this could happen in its annual filing in 2022, according to The Washington Post. That, in turn, could make things even more dire for the car company. \n“If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline,” Tesla wrote.\n“We are not a party to these loans,” the company added. \nIt already seemed like Musk was going to have trouble paying back his loans for X. Last year, the social media company reported that its value had plummeted by more than half, to around $19 billion. When the banks formulated a plan to restructure the loan, X didn’t follow through, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\nTesla stock was doing slightly better on Wednesday, as a result of an uptick in the wider market caused by a report that inflation had eased slightly in February.\nThis story has been updated.\nDemocratic Representative John Larson erupted during a Department of Government Efficiency House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday, verbalizing the immense frustration felt by much of the country. \n“Where’s the independence of the committee?” Larson yelled at House Republicans. “Where’s the legislature? We’re an equal branch of government.”\nMusk did not attend the meeting, which infuriated Larson.\n“Where’s Elon Musk?” he asked, pointing to Musk’s empty seat. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated. But that does not put him above the law, or the responsibility to come before this committee and this Congress.”\nSince Donald Trump took office, Musk’s DOGE has fired thousands of federal workers, gutted the United States Agency for International Development, and cut more than $500 million in funding to the Department of Education. \nThe billionaire has also attacked Social Security through a number of fraudulent claims, and admitted that the social safety net program is on the chopping block in a recent Fox News interview, despite Trump promising not to touch Social Security.\n“If he’s so great, if these plans and all the fraud and abuse that he’s found are so eminent, why isn’t he here explaining it?” Larson demanded of Republicans. “You know why. Because he wants to privatize Social Security.”\nThe party that claims to ride for free speech is tripping over itself trying to explain why its kidnapping of Mahmoud Khalil isn’t a blatant violation of the First Amendment.\n“When you are on campuses—I hear ‘freedom of speech,’ ‘freedom of speech,’ ‘freedom of speech’—can you stand at a movie theater and yell ‘Fire’? Can you slander? Free speech has limitations,” Trump border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday during an appearance with the New York Republican Party.\n“When you go on a college campus and you wanna start protesting, and locking down and taking over buildings, and damaging property, and handing out leaflets for Hamas—who is a terrorist organization—coming to this country either on a visa or becoming a resident alien is a great privilege, but there are rules associated with that,” Homan continued. “You might have been able to get away with that stuff in the last administration, but you won’t under this administration.”\nHoman’s statement proves yet again that the only free speech that conservatives actually care about is their own. Khalil was arrested for having the courage to speak out and organize against the ongoing genocide of Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli government.\n“What say you @JDVance. You just lectured Europe that in DC , ‘there is a new sheriff in town, & under Trump’s leadership we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square agree or disagree,’” Representative Ro Khanna wrote on X. “Did Mr. Homan not get the memo?”\nThe economy is in turmoil, and the Trump administration says it’s because they just haven’t had enough time to salvage it from Joe Biden.\n“When can you not blame it [the economy] on President Biden and when does it fully become President Trump’s responsibility?” a reporter asked White House press secretary Caroline Leavitt Wednesday.\n“Well, we’ve only been here 52 days,” Leavitt responded.\nA reminder: In just 52 days, Trump has started a global trade war, plummeted the stock market, fired thousands of federal workers, slashed government funding, and sparked fears of a recession. Fifty-six percent of Americans disapprove of the way the president has handled the economy since returning to office, according to a recent CNN poll. \n“The president is working hard everyday to bring down the cost of living, which we see is already happening. You see the cost of eggs is going down, the cost of gasoline is going down, because of the massive regulatory efforts of this president,” Leavitt said.\nThat’s not true. Egg prices are at an all-time high, costing on average $8.42 per dozen. Gas prices are down, but that’s likely due to economic uncertainty from Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Even the president himself hasn’t ruled out a recession. \n“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America,” Trump said in a Fox News interview Sunday, after he was asked about the possibility of a recession this year. “That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.” \nLeavitt added that all Trump needs to help the economy flourish is for Congress to pass tax cuts for the rich.\nAfter less than two months in office, Trump has already claimed to be the “most consequential President of our time.” If the goal of a president is to disrupt international order and shake the foundations of democracy at the expense of American citizens, that may be true. \nDonald Trump is once again joking about overstaying his welcome at the White House.\nDuring an appearance Wednesday at the annual “Friends of Ireland” luncheon at the U.S. Capitol, Trump joked that he hoped to attend the event next year, and the next, and the next, and …\n“Hopefully we’re gonna be doing this at least three more times, OK? We’re going to be doing this three more times, at least,” Trump said.\n“When I say ‘at least’ they go absolutely crazy,” Trump said, referring ostensibly to the media present in the room. \nTrump: Hopefully we’re going to be doing this at least three more times.. When I say at least, they go absolutely crazy pic.twitter.com/Xzg0CSPdTR\nThe president seems to delight in making little cracks about illegally extending his presidency to a third term, and deriding the media for taking any of it seriously.\nBut the reason the media takes it so seriously is because of the deadly riot that took place only a little more than four years ago, at the very same U.S. Capitol where Trump spoke Wednesday. Trump refused to concede that he’d lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, upending the democratic pillar that is a peaceful transition of power.\nCut to four years later, and Trump continues to insist the election was stolen from him, and doesn’t seem to have any greater respect for legal precedent.\nLast month, Trump made another jarring statement that we can take a little bit more seriously. While speaking at the Republican Governors’ Dinner, Trump underscored the significance of the 2026 midterm elections, claiming that he’d “raised $608 million in three weeks”—funds that he implied he could use to help “some of his friends” keep their seats, or maybe his own reelection bid.\n“So we’ve got that money, and I got to spend it somewhere, and they tell me I’m not allowed to run,” Trump said. “I’m not sure. Is that true? I’m not sure.”\nThe Social Security Administration might slash the telephone service that millions of retired and disabled Americans use to apply for and access their earned benefits.\nThe Washington Post reports that the Department of Government Efficiency is pressuring the agency to root out alleged fraud, and in response, the SSA is considering ending its phone service, which processes claims and bank transactions through direct deposit. Instead, the agency would direct elderly and disabled people to the internet and in-person field offices.\nWhile the decision is not yet finalized, a meeting held Tuesday at the agency wasn’t positive. DOGE workers pressed SSA officials about possible phone fraud, but weren’t receptive when the officials suggested solutions. The DOGE personnel “weren’t interested in anything else but defending the decision that they had already made,” one of Post’s sources said.\nCurrent and former Social Security officials told the Post that the move to curtail its phone system would threaten the agency’s ability to serve the public, especially since older and disabled Social Security recipients have difficulty using the internet, as well as visiting offices in person.\n“It is a 180-degree policy shift,” said one employee. “It would be the single largest service disruption in agency history ever.”\nThere are about 9.5 million Social Security claims each year for retirement, disability, and survivor benefits as well as Supplemental Security Income, and in 2024, the agency paid out benefits worth $1.5 trillion. Eighty-six percent of Americans age 65 and over receive Social Security payments. About 40 percent of claims are made on the phone, and the agency received 81.2 million phone calls to its toll-free number in 2023.\nThe phone service is also used to answer questions about retirement, benefits, and death benefit forms, among other issues. While employees in the agency say fraud is a problem, it’s not widespread enough to justify ditching the phone service altogether. But since the DOGE service launched, Musk and the Trump administration have constantly pushed for widespread cuts, alleging massive fraud in nearly every government agency despite little evidence.\nAt the SSA, Musk and DOGE have alleged that “tens of millions” of dead people are receiving Social Security payments, but this was quickly disproven. Still, Trump and Musk have continued to double down on the claims, with the tech mogul–fascism enthusiast calling Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and repeatedly urging massive cuts. \nThe FBI is moving to criminalize groups like Habitat for Humanity for receiving grants from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration. \nCitibank revealed in a court filing Wednesday that it was told to freeze the groups’ bank accounts at the FBI’s request. The reason? The FBI alleges that the groups are involved in “possible criminal violations,” including “conspiracy to defraud the United States.”\n“The FBI has told Citibank that recipients of EPA climate grants are being considered as potentially liable for fraud. That is, the Trump administration wants to criminalize work on climate science and impacts,” the @capitolhunters account wrote Wednesday on X. “An incoming administration not only cancels federal grants but declares recipients as criminals. All these grantees applied under government calls FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORK, were reviewed and accepted. Trump wants to jail them.“\nThe Appalachian Community Capital Corporation, the Coalition for Green Capital, and the DC Green Bank are just some of the nonprofits being targeted. \n“This is not fraud. This is targeted harassment,” @capitolhunters continued. “The idea of criminalizing community climate work wouldn’t have originated at the FBI—it likely comes from EPA director Lee Zeldin, who today cut all EPA’s environmental justice offices, which try to reduce pollution in poor and minority communities.”\nZeldin’s order eliminates 10 EPA regional offices as well as the one in Washington, D.C.\nConsumers across the world are boycotting American products in protest of literally everything Donald Trump is doing.\nIn Canada, American liquor, wine, and spirits have been pulled off the shelves in response to Trump’s tariff war with America’s northern ally. Canadians have booed the American national anthem at hockey games, and trips across the southern border dropped 23 percent last month from the same time last year.\nIn Sweden and Denmark, people are calling for a boycott of American companies, including McDonalds, Amazon, and KFC, after Trump pulled military funding for Ukraine. A Danish Facebook group, Boykot varer fra USA, which translates to “Boycott Goods from the U.S.,” has over 70,000 members. Users post about alternatives to American products, and support one another in boycotting American products.\n“I have been in the group for a few days and can already feel my joy at my increased consumer awareness,” one user posted.\nAnd across the world, electric vehicle buyers are refusing to buy Teslas in rejection of Elon Musk’s shadow presidency, his support for the far-right German party AfD, his hand gesture that looked like a Nazi salute, his slashing of federal funding through the Department of Government Efficiency … the list goes on.\nIn Germany, Europe’s largest market for E.V.s, Tesla’s sales are down 70 percent since last year. Sales are plummeting in Australia, Sweden, and Norway too. The company’s stock dropped 15 percent on Monday alone.\nTrump tried to defend Musk, and said he will buy a Tesla in support of “Elon’s baby.”\n“To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is putting it ‘on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they so often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers and Elon’s baby,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nIt’s unclear just how effective the global boycott of American products and culture will be, but it no doubt indicates the world is fed up with Trump’s and his reckless pursuit of chaos.\nA federal judge stopped a hearing about Donald Trump’s ban on transgender military service members in its tracks Wednesday, calling for a recess from proceedings to invite the Department of Justice’s lawyer to actually read up on the policy they were defending. \nU.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes had criticized the department’s lawyer for not having read three reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cited in his policy banning transgender members of the military, according to Politico’s senior legal affairs reporter Kyle Cheney, who posted several updates on the hearing on X. \nAn internal memo issued by the Pentagon in February “disqualified” transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. \n“Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service,” the memo said, also banning individuals who had a “history of cross-sex hormone therapy or a history of sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria or in pursuit of a sex transition.” \nReyes claimed that Hegseth’s policy banning transgender service members had “egregiously misquoted” the three reports it cited, and she couldn’t believe that the Justice Department’s lawyer hadn’t bothered to actually read them. \nReyes requested that the court take a 30-minute break, and asked the department’s lawyer to review the reports and compare how they’d been misquoted by Hegseth in his policy. Then, they could tell her whether they believe she could reasonably rely on Hegseth’s interpretation of those reports.\nWhen the court resumed, Reyes pointed out that one study Hegseth had relied on to demonstrate that transgender service members hurt troop readiness and weaken their unit, actually concluded the exact opposite. The study found that transgender service members were more deployable, and experienced fewer lapses in their service than those diagnosed with depression, who were not automatically excluded from service.\nBut that wasn’t all. As Reyes went through each of the findings cited in the ban, she found that “virtually every” one contradicted support for Hegseth’s policy, according to Cheney.\nReyes asked the DOJ lawyer why she should defer to Hegseth’s blatant “cherrypicking” and providing “misleading” analysis. \nIn a brief memo filed in court on February 10, Hegseth directed the military to stop integrating new recruits “with a history of gender dysphoria” and to pause “planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition.” The policy wouldn’t affect the estimated 9,000 to 14,000 transgender individuals currently serving the military.\nLater in February, as part of a complaint the Pentagon filed against Reyes, accusing her of “misconduct,” indicating potential bias in the case, an internal Pentagon memo was revealed that pushed the ban even further. \nHegseth’s policy notes that transgender service members “may be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a compelling Government interest.” \nTo obtain an exemption, a soldier must demonstrate “stability” in their sex for 36 consecutive months, demonstrate that they have never attempted to transition to any sex other than their sex, and be willing to adhere to any standards associated with their sex, according to Fox News.\nHegseth’s memo followed Trump’s executive order revoking a Biden-era policy allowing transgender service members in the military. “Consistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,” the order said. \nThis story has been updated.\nIn a rare display of credibility, even Fox hosts aren’t buying the Trump administration’s lies about tariffs.\nIn an interview Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Fox Business anchor Stuart Varney pointed to the rising cost of aluminum, steel, and copper from Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported metals, which went into effect the same day.\n“That could ripple through the entire manufacturing sector and raise the level of inflation. Could that lead to a recession?” Varney pressed Lutnick. \nLutnick dodged the question, proceeded to mansplain inflation, and—of course—blame national debt on the Democrats.\n“Let’s take a step back and remember inflation, right? Inflation comes from a government printing too much money. The Biden administration having a $2 trillion deficit,” Lutnick said. \n“You don’t get inflation from having a tariff, because what a tariff says is if it’s made in Europe, if it’s made foreign, it might cost a little more, but that which is made in America does not cost more,” he went on, before implying the solution is merely to support American manufacturers.\n“We make plenty of steel in America.”\nSeemingly stunned by Lutnick’s ignorance, Varney pointed to the obvious. “Domestic producers can’t keep up with the demand,” he said. \nHe’s right. In 2023, the U.S. imported 23.6 million tons of steel and imported 44 percent of its aluminum in the same year, a demand that is much too high for struggling American metal producers to meet. \nA failure to meet demand will lead to higher prices on everything from cars, refrigerators, beers, and canned goods to home appliances, experts warn. \n“The supply is limited, the demand is strong, the price is going up,” Varney added, pressing the former private equity CEO.\nLutnick’s solution? Build more manufacturing plants, which could take years. All the while, American manufacturers and consumers will continue to suffer from Trump’s disastrous global trade war."

The index, after having its worst day of the year on Monday, finished Tuesday with a loss of 1.2%.\n“This is the first market day we’ve had in which investors have been saying they’re really afraid of an economic slowdown,” Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, told Quartz.\nTrading was very unusual on Tuesday, with industrials and banks way off.\nOther major indices, such as the Nasdaq Composite, shed 0.35%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 670 points or 1.5% by the end of the day in New York.\nTesla (TSLA+2.96%) stock declined on Tuesday due to rising fears about tariffs among investors — car prices may be driven higher by the duties. The company also has a large presence in China, including a major assembly plant, and so may be vulnerable to retaliation by Beijing.\nAdditionally, Bank of America (BAC+0.55%) reduced its price target for the stock to $380 from $490 while maintaining a Neutral rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas yesterday had designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised his price target to $430.\nTarget’s (TGT-2.98%) stock fell after it said it expects a “meaningful” year-on-year decline in first-quarter profits compared and CEO Brian Cornell warned that the new tariffs may prompt the retailer to increase prices as soon as next week. The company’s fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations.\nBest Buy (BBY+0.03%) stock dropped 12% after company executives warned that the duties could increase the prices of goods it sells and could reduce its comparable sales if they stay in place for a full year. The electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.\nChipotle (CMG+0.21%) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados that are 50% sourced from Mexico.

            "full_content": "Eli Lilly (LLY-1.87%) believes its experimental weight-loss pill could make GLP-1 treatments more accessible worldwide.\n“We feel that a product like an oral, orforglipron, could serve a significant amount of patients globally,” Eli Lilly CFO Lucas Montarce said Monday at the Leerink (SIVB) 2025 Global Healthcare Conference.\nMontarce laid out several reasons why a pill could broaden access to the GLP-1 class of drugs, which was made famous by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.58%)  Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.62%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030.\nMontarce said their are many markets where patients prefer an oral option over an injection — like the current GLP-1s on the market. Pills are also cheaper and more simple to produce and distribute than injections, making them easier to scale globally. \nAdditionally, government and insurance providers may be more likely to cover an oral medication over an injectable, potentially expanding access through public health systems.\nOrforglipron is currently in a phase 3 trial. Earlier trials found that it helped users lose an average of nearly 15% of weight after 36 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks.\nEli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told Bloomberg News in January that phase 3 trial results are expected before the middle of 2025. That could lead to regulatory approval for the drug in 2026.\nAt the time, Ricks said  that a pill would be easier to manufacture en masse — and more simple for patients to consume — than rival medications. Most major weight-loss drugs are delivered by weekly injections, including  Zepbound, Wegovy, and Ozempic.\nNovo Nordisk is also working on a GLP-1 weight-loss pill. Last, year the company said  that patients that took a once-daily 50mg dose of its pill, amycretin,  lost an average of 10.4% of their weight in just three months, according to an abstract of the study. Trial participants that took two pills lost even more weight, 13.1% at three months.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on automakers could ripple beyond the automotive industry, with SiriusXM (SIRI+1.00%) now expressing concern about potential impacts to its subscription-based business model.\nThe company, which is home to radio and podcast icons like Howard Stern, Alex Cooper, and Conan O’Brien, relies on new car sales to drive subscriber growth. CEO Jennifer Witz said SiriusXM is “watching very closely” for potential fallout from the new administration’s economic policies — especially tariffs, but also broader concerns like consumer confidence and “worries about inflation.”\nWitz said the satellite radio giant expected “relatively stable” new car sales at the beginning of the year, but Trump’s trade war undermined that expectation.\n“It’s hard to say right now where that’s going to land,” Witz said Wednesday at the Morgan Stanley (MS+0.62%) Technology, Media & Telecom Conference. “The first two months were very strong, but again with potential tariffs going in place, it could impact the new car side of the business.”\nTrump’s tariffs, which took effect Tuesday, include a 25% duty on all Mexican imports, most Canadian goods, and a 20% tariff on imports from China. A day later, however, he granted major U.S. automakers a one-month exemption from the new Canadian and Mexican tariffs. And on Thursday, he announced that Mexico will not face tariffs on any goods covered under the United States-Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade agreement through April 2.\nIf and when the tariffs go into full effect — and if other countries retaliate —the cost of manufacturing new cars will rise, likely pushing up car prices and slowing sales. That could spell trouble for SiriusXM, which gets many of its new subscribers through free trials in newly purchased vehicles.\nFortunately for SiriusXM, used car sales should be unfazed by all of this. Witz noted that used cars account for 50% of SiriusXM’s trial subscriptions.\nShe added that the company will try to navigate these uncertainties by focusing on longer-term subscriptions and refining its pricing and packaging strategies.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.58%) released clinical trial results for its potential Ozempic successor on Monday, disappointing Wall Street for the second time.\nThe pharmaceutical giant, known for its blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic, announced on Monday that patients taking its experimental diabetes and weight-loss drug, CagriSema, lost an average of 15.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks in a phase 3 clinical trial.\nThis was the second of four planned phase 3 studies of the drug. The first trial, called REDEFINE 1, tested CagriSema in people who were obese or overweight but did not have type 2 diabetes. In that study, patients lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight after 68 weeks.\nThe second study, REDEFINE 2, focused on 1,206 patients who were obese or overweight and had type 2 diabetes. Neither trial met the company’s or analysts’ expectations of a 25% average weight loss.\nNovo Nordisk had hoped that by mimicking multiple hormones, CagriSema would deliver greater weight loss. The drug combines semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — with cagrilintide, a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist, hence the name CagriSema.\nFor comparison, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY-1.87%) rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks.\nNovo Nordisk’s stock fell more than 8% on Monday morning following the news.\n“We had believed that adults living with both overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes represent the patient segment for which CagriSema has the best chance to outperform Zepbound. Therefore, we believe today’s results are especially disappointing,” William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh wrote in a note.\nCagriSema belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 or incretin medications, popularized by Ozempic. These drugs mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and reduce appetite.\nMorgan Stanley (MS+0.62%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. As a result, several pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop more powerful weight-loss medications.\nNovo Nordisk currently plans to file for regulatory approval for CagriSema in the first quarter of 2026.\n“We look forward to bringing this second pivotal trial to regulatory authorities with the aim of making this next-generation therapy available to the millions of patients in need,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, in a press release. \nMeanwhile, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX-4.68%) and Amgen (AMGN-3.23%), which are also developing next-generation weight-loss drugs, saw their stocks rise 3.5% and 1%, respectively, on Monday.\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

            "full_content": "By Jill Goldsmith \n\nLachlan Murdoch said Fox is targeting a fall football season launch for its new streaming platform run by Pete Distad with modest initial subscriber projections in the “mid-single digit millions.”\n\n\tHe announced last month the streamer would launch by year end, saying it would be “holistic” of all the company’s content including Fox Sports and Fox News.\n\n\tIn comments at the Morgan Stanley media conference, the Fox CEO was again extremely careful to stress that the goal is not to cannibalize linear television and Fox will not advertise it on linear television but is meant purely to capture those who cut the cord or have never subscribed to cable. More details like the name and price are still to come.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMike Myers Joins Canadian Election Campaign & New PM With True North & \"Elbows Up\" Battle Cry Against Trump\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“We brought Pete in and Pete’s focus at Venu and now at our venture is new subscribers that are outside of the bundle,” Murdoch said. Distad had been CEO of Venu Sports, the streaming joint venture of Fox, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. Advances under Venu, which was sued but shuttered before it went to court or launched, have been key in allowing the new service to get up to speed relatively quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMurdoch also offered another tidbit on its original streaming service, Fox Nation, designed to bring longer form content to the Fox News “superfan” – it’s got 2 to 2.5 million subscribers.\n\n\tHe also called NFL games on Tubi “a huge opportunity” after a blockbuster Super Bowl for Fox and the ad-supported streamer. \n\n\t“Despite not the best game, we achieved record ratings, 126 million viewers. Tubi generated about 24 million viewers, and about 15.5 million concurrent views watching the stream.” Key, he said, is that each viewer – former and new – of the game had to register and “about 40% of the audience on Tubi has not used Tubi before.”\n\n\tPhiladelphia routed Kansas City 40-22 in a lopsided Super Bowl 59.\n\n\t“Look, there’s lots of arguments.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk wants to privatize the United States Postal Service.\nSpeaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom conference on Wednesday, Musk said the government \"should try to privatize everything we possibly can,\" including the USPS, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.\nMusk acknowledged that privatizing it would probably require congressional approval.\nYet, while Musk envisions a private US postal system, another country is taking a different approach — shutting down its traditional letter-delivery service altogether.\nDenmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, announced in a recent update that it would stop delivering letters in the country at the end of this year and would focus on parcel deliveries.\nIt said the volume of letters handled in Denmark plummeted by 90% from 2000 to 2024.\nAs e-commerce booms, the company said it would be prioritizing the \"growing need\" for faster and more reliable parcel deliveries.\n\"Danes have become more and more digital, and what was once sent by letter is now received digitally by the vast majority of people,\" it added.\nOn its website, PostNord said its history of letter delivery could be traced back to 1624. The company, which also operates in Sweden and says its letter delivery there will continue, said it would start to remove its 1,500 post boxes in Denmark in June.\nIn a separate statement Thursday, PostNord said it would cut about 1,500 jobs this year, reducing its workforce by nearly a third.\nDenmark isn't alone — Germany's Deutsche Post on Thursday said it would eliminate 8,000 jobs in 2025, calling the move a \"socially responsible\" reaction to declining mail volumes.\nWhile some European countries are moving away from traditional letter delivery, President Donald Trump, like Musk, has floated the idea of privatizing the USPS.\nIn December, Trump said privatizing it was \"not the worst idea I've ever heard,\" and in February he said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \"will be looking\" into it.\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe USPS has already undergone significant restructuring in recent years.\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy told the House oversight committee in December that the Postal Service had reduced its overall head count by about 20,000 employees and cut 45 million total work hours since he took office in June 2020.\nHave a tip?

Le Borse europee concludono la giornata in ordine sparso, appesantite dal malumore di Wall Street dopo il dato sulla fiducia dei consumatori Usa sotto le attese. A farne le spese è anche il bitcoin che scivola sotto i 90mila dollari, ai minimi da tre mesi.     A brillare moderatamente è la Borsa di Milano, con l'indice Ftse Mib che sale dello 0,63% a 38.714 punti, dopo aver sfiorato i 39mila punti, ai massimi da novembre 2007. Giornata positiva anche per Madrid (+0,8%) e Londra (+0,1%). In calo Parigi (-0,4%), poco mossa Francoforte (-0,07%). Nel Vecchio continente la lente degli investitori è rivolta sulla Germania, dove sono in corso i colloqui tra le forze politiche per la formazione del nuovo governo.\n    Un quadro che spinge al rialzo l'euro sul dollaro mentre sono in calo i rendimenti dei titoli di Stato. Su questi ultimi pesano i timori di una pausa della Bce sul taglio dei tassi d'interesse. In una posizione attendista sembra attestarsi anche la Fed che guarda all'andamento dell'inflazione, prima di agire sulla politica monetaria. Sul fronte dei titoli di Stato, lo spread tra Btp e Bund, intanto, ha concluso in calo a 113 punti, con il rendimento del decennale italiano al 3,58% e quello tedesco al 2,45%.\n    A Piazza Affari un report di Morgan Stanley ha messo le ali alle banche. La banca d'affari americana ha espresso apprezzamento per gli istituti di credito italiano per i risultati finanziari, da poco presentati, ma anche per le operazioni di consolidamento annunciate nei mesi scorsi. Gli analisti hanno aggiornato le stime per le banche italiane \"che copriamo tenendo conto degli sforzi del management\" nel mantenere la redditività attraverso una \"serie di leve, tra cui la generazione di commissioni, l'efficienza dei costi e la solidità della qualità degli attivi\". Una valutazione che ha portato ad un balzo di Mps (+5,3% a 6,96 euro), alle prese con l'offerta su Mediobanca (+1,5% a 16,82 euro). Avanza Unicredit (+2,8% a 49,33 euro) con l'operazione su Banco Bpm (+2,1% a 9,37 euro). Tra le banche coinvolte nel risiko salgono anche la Popolare di Sondrio (+2,7% a 10,63 euro) destinataria dell'ops di Bper (+2% a 7,10 euro) e Unipol (+1,4%), socia di entrambi.\n    Cresce anche Intesa (+1,8 a 4,62 euro).     Morgan Stanley continua a ritenere che i principali catalizzatori per Unicredit e Banco Bpm si \"concentrino sull'M&A, sul quale restano incertezze sui tempi e sui prezzi delle offerte\".    \n\n\nRiproduzione riservata © Copyright ANSA\n\n\n\n\n\n          Condividi\n        \nVeloci, dettagliate, verificate.

Поэтому от Intel исходит посыл, что TSMC — «отличный поставщик», несмотря на конкуренцию.\nВ силу этих причин Intel продолжит отдавать TSMC часть производства на аутсорс, хотя производит собственные узлы по 18А техпроцессу. К тому же вместо использования своего собственного узла 20A Intel передала работу TSMC, чтобы подрядчик производил кремний на своём 3-нм узле. Также Intel сосредоточена на работе над своей передовой технологией упаковки Foveros 3D на своих упаковочных предприятиях в США.\nОднако и такое сотрудничество обходится Intel дорого, так как стоимость использования TSMC включена в общую стоимость создания этих процессоров и потому уменьшает валовую прибыль компании.\nferra.ru, 2025 г. 18+\nНашли опечатку?

            "full_content": "Update font size. Reset\nLast week, Bloomberg News reported that Apple is postponing Apple Intelligence updates to its Siri digital assistant — a vital link between customers and the company’s hardware — pushing them well into the future.\nThese delays coincide with speculation that Apple CEO Tim Cook may finally be considering a shake-up in the leadership of the company’s AI division, which is pivotal to Apple’s growth trajectory in the years ahead.\nIn a note released on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring highlighted the Siri delay and reduced his stock price target by $23, lowering it to $252 per share.\nMartin Baccardax for TheStreet:\n ‎\n\nApple shares have slumped more than 15% from their record peak in mid-December, shedding nearly $600 billion in value along the way, as investors worry over the slower-than-expected demand for its new iPhone 16 and mixed reception for its new Apple Intelligence AI rollout.\n“The postponement of an advanced Siri integrated into Apple Intelligence is likely to temper (next twelve month) iPhone upgrade rates vs. our prior expectations,” Woodring and his team wrote.\n“[Around] 50% of iPhone owners that didn’t upgrade to an iPhone 16 acknowledged that the delayed Apple Intelligence rollout had an impact on their decision not to upgrade,” Woodring noted…\n“We are [also] incorporating $2 billion of higher product input costs in 2025 to account for China tariffs,” Woodring said, noting that some of that total will be mitigated by the company itself.\nA component of that mitigation was revealed last month, when Apple said it would pair with its key supplier to build an AI-focused data center in Texas as part of a broader plan to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.\n\n‎\nMacDailyNews Take: If you don’t want to hear the unvarnished truth about Apple Inc., stop reading now and instead go visit one of those Apple-captured websites or YouTubers.\nYou know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years.\nOperations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date.\nYou can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024\nTim “Mr. Myopic” Cook is approximately half a decade behind the curve. Cook should have seen the failure in the company’s AI efforts years ago and made meaningful changes to the failed the leadership of the company’s AI division. Just looking at Siri, he’s approximately a decade late. Late, late, late; he’s always late. Cook is reactive, not proactive, because he’s a competent, albeit one-note (outsource to cheap-labor Communist China) operations manager occupying role that instead requires an extraordinary, visionary leader.\nFor far too many years now, Tim Cook has been handicapping Apple.\nApple is suffering a crisis of leadership and the company is paying the price for having Tim Cook at the helm for far too long. – MacDailyNews, March 3, 2025\nApple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit.\nWhere’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.”\nAAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposedly in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024\nApple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct…  Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards.\nApple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.].\nThis is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024\nThe new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024\nWhen you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024\nExecuting a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. – MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024\n‎\nPlease help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Eric Halperin, the CFPB’s former head of enforcement, told CNBC that doing so also means there’s no way “of clawing back funds for consumer relief.” Representatives from Zelle, JPMorgan, and the Consumer Bankers Association each praised the ruling in statements to the outlet.\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration, including Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have pushed hard to effectively shut down the CFPB. The agency has only published one enforcement action since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and under acting Director Russell Vought it’s dropped several cases that were brought by its Biden-era leader, Rohit Chopra. Agency employees are currently fighting in court to halt the move, alleging they’ve been prevented from carrying out legally mandated duties — including responding to urgent consumer complaints.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

On Tuesday the administration dropped its case against Zelle, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Arizona.\nZelle and its parent banks are just the latest enforcement target to be abandoned by the CFPB, which is currently led by acting director Russell Vought. Last week the bureau dropped cases it was litigating against five companies including Capital One, Rocket Homes and others. It had earlier dropped its case against online lending platform SoLo Funds.\nThe CFPB has also been decimated in a matter of weeks, with agency's employees ordered to stop essentially all work, while some 150 employees have been fired. The bureau's D.C. headquarters has also been shuttered.\nA spokesperson for Zelle said it welcomed the CFPB's decision to drop the case, stating that \"this lawsuit was without merit, and legally and factually flawed.\"\nBut consumer advocates decried the move. \"Dismissing this lawsuit against the big banks that own Zelle is another troubling sign that the CFPB's new leadership is dramatically pulling back from enforcing the law and protecting consumers who have been mistreated by banks and other financial firms,\" said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement.\n\"Fraud has become increasingly common on payment apps like Zelle and consumers have little chance of recovering their money from their bank if they get tricked into sending a payment to scammers,\" Bell added.\nMeanwhile, the Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said the banks had followed the law. \n\"In a time when fraud and scam activity is surging across industries and government alike, we look forward to moving past finger pointing and political grandstanding and, instead, working constructively with policymakers to counter the root causes of these threats,\" Johnson said in a statement.\nThe bureau long been unpopular with Republicans, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley who say it is too heavy-handed in its regulation. When President Trump was asked last month whether his goal was to have CFPB totally eliminated, Trump said yes. Elon Musk has tweeted \"CFPB RIP.\"\nThe bureau was created by Congress as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nNew allegations tied to a mortgage fraud scandal that rocked the industry and landed an executive in federal prison now implicate JPMorgan, the lender on the deal, and the borrower — New York’s Chetrit Group.\nWells Fargo, which filed suit in federal civil court as trustee on a $481 million CMBS loan, alleges JPMorgan knew the mortgage it made to Chetrit for a national multifamily portfolio was based on inflated financials. But it doled out the debt anyway.\nThe suit — first reported by Reuters — also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into mortgage fraud. In 2023, Roco principal Tyler Ross pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\nWells Fargo’s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers’ fraud.\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself “a victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.”\n“Financial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,” said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n“We suffered great financial loss due to the seller’s fraud,” the spokesperson said. “As a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.”\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco’s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.\nThe Chetrits then brought the fraudulent financials to JPMorgan’s attention.\nInternally, the lender acknowledged the reporting was unreliable, according to the complaint. An analyst handling due diligence on the deal texted a colleague that the financial statements were “‘made up’” and “‘ridic[ulous],’” the suit details.\nUltimately, the 10,000-unit portfolio traded for $522 million, the suit states. The deal was risky — a $481 million loan on a $522 million acquisition shakes out to an incredible 92 percent loan-to-value ratio. But JPMorgan knew it would insulate itself from problems by immediately securitizing the deal, and pocket millions of dollars in fees to boot, according to the lawsuit.\nJPMorgan “was willing to issue such a risky loan because it never intended to hold it,” the suit said. Rather, the risk would be passed on to the deal’s unwitting bondholders, who now face tens of millions of dollars in losses, the suit alleges.\nWells Fargo argues JPMorgan “had an obligation” to validate whether the figures were accurate.\nChetrit defaulted on the debt in 2022 after the deals failed to generate sufficient cash flow to service the loan. In early 2023, a spokesperson for the firm said it was looking to sell assets to right the ship.\nThe firm nabbed a temporary forbearance agreement in June 2023 but defaulted on the terms just a few months later, according to Morningstar Credit. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 and the past year has seen a spate of foreclosures: four Texas properties, three in Alabama, seven in Mississippi, according to Morningstar.\nPre-foreclosure filings in Florida, Ohio, Arkansas and Louisiana are pending, as of last month.\nMeanwhile, the Wells Fargo suit seeks to hold Meyer Chetrit, the guarantor on the debt, personally liable for the potential tens of millions in losses to the trust.\nThe trustee demands JPMorgan either repurchase the loan or pay damages to cover the trust’s losses.\nChetrit making progress on pesky $481M loan\nFannie Mae says it suffered losses from commercial mortgage fraud\nReal estate executive pleads guilty to multi-year conspiracy to falsify financial statements\nThis article originally appeared on The Real Deal.

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is dropping its lawsuit against the company that runs the Zelle payment platform and three U.S. banks as federal agencies continue to pull back on previous enforcement actions now that President Donald Trump is back in office.\nIn December a federal regulator sued JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, claiming the banks failed to protect hundreds of thousands of consumers from rampant fraud on Zelle, in violation of consumer financial laws.\nIn the federal civil complaint, the CFPB asserted that the banks rushed to get the peer-to-peer payments platform to market without effective safeguards against fraud and then, after consumers complained about being defrauded on the service, largely denied them relief.\nEarly Warning Services, a fintech company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that operates Zelle, was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. EWS is owned by seven U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Those three banks are the largest financial institutions on the Zelle network, accounting for 73% of activity on Zelle in 2023.\nBut a filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on Tuesday indicated that the CFPB was dismissing its lawsuit against EWS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo with prejudice.\nThe dismissal comes less than a week after the CFPB dropped several enforcement actions against companies like Capital One and Rocket Homes.\nIn notices of voluntary dismissals that were filed, the CFPB dropped lawsuits it had brought against Capital One, Rocket Homes, Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, and others.\nThose suits were all filed under the agency’s previous director, Rohit Chopra, who Trump fired just weeks ago. The CPFB has since plunged into turmoil — with the White House later ordering it to halt nearly all its work. The administration also closed the agency’s headquarters and moved to fire scores of its workers.\nTrump has defended his administration’s broadside against the CFPB — including recent claims about the agency being “set up to destroy people.” But supporters of the agency stress that it provides crucial oversight and protects consumers from being vulnerable to predatory business practices.\nThe CPFB isn’t the only federal agency to signal a pullback on previous enforcement action under the new administration. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has either closed or paused legal action against several cryptocurrency platforms in recent weeks, as the regulator tries to present itself as more crypto-friendly under Trump.\nLast month Binance and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause its high-profile lawsuit against the crypto exchange. The SEC filed a similar joint motion with Coinbase. In addition, Robinhood has said that the case against it has been closed.\nSign in to access your portfolio"

            "full_content": "by Calculated Risk on 3/17/2025 10:00:00 AM\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported the housing market index (HMI) was at 39, down from 42 last month.  Any number below 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.\n\nFrom the NAHB: Builder Confidence Falls on Cost Uncertainty\nEconomic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March even as builders express hope that a better regulatory environment will lead to an improving business climate.\n\nBuilder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes was 39 in March, down three points from February and the lowest level in seven months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.\n\n“Builders continue to face elevated building material costs that are exacerbated by tariff issues, as well as other supply-side challenges that include labor and lot shortages,” said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, N.C. “At the same time, builders are starting to see relief on the regulatory front to bend the rising cost curve, as demonstrated by the Trump administration's pause of the 2021 IECC building code requirement and move to implement the regulatory definition of ‘waters of the United States’ under the Clean Water Act consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.”\n\n“Construction firms are facing added cost pressures from tariffs,” said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. “Data from the HMI March survey reveals that builders estimate a typical cost effect from recent tariff actions at $9,200 per home. Uncertainty on policy is also having a negative impact on home buyers and development decisions.”\n\nThe latest HMI survey also revealed that 29% of builders cut home prices in March, up from 26% in February. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 5% in March, the same rate as the previous month. The use of sales incentives was 59% in March, unchanged from February. \n...\nThe HMI index gauging current sales conditions fell three points to 43 in March, its lowest point since December 2023. The gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers dropped five points to 24 while the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months held steady at 47.\n\nLooking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast fell three points in March to 54, the Midwest moved three points lower to 42, the South dropped four points to 42 and the West posted a two-point decline to 37.\nemphasis added Click on graph for larger image.\n\nThis graph shows the NAHB index since Jan 1985.\n\nThis was below the consensus forecast."

            "full_content": "Anthony has never been interested in attending town halls, but when texts started rolling in about his top boss' remote work diatribe, it was too much for the technology vice president to ignore.\nAn IT employee named Nicolas Welch had questioned JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon while he was visiting an office in Columbus, Ohio, about leaving some return-to-office decisions up to managers. Dimon launched into an expletive-laced response, in which he complained about employees not paying attention on Zoom and that there's \"not a goddamn person\" he could get a hold of on Fridays.\nThe audio of the exchange went viral. It also struck a nerve, and now some employees are considering leaving, teaming up to influence work policy, or, like Anthony, entertaining job offers from rival banks.\n\"Jamie Dimon's like, 'Well, hey, if you don't like it, you know where the door is.' Yes, we do,\" said Anthony, which is a pseudonym to protect his identity since he was not authorized to speak about internal matters. \"And that's going to impact him. He's going to lose some good people.\"\nJPMorgan has long prided itself on being a tech-driven bank, with a $17 billion IT budget and nearly 60,000 technology workers. To stay ahead of its rivals and keep clients engaged, it funds research and development across cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and crypto.\nBusiness Insider spoke with two recruiters and five JPMorgan employees, four of whom requested anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, who said the bank's unpopular RTO mandate could spell trouble for the bank's ability to retain and attract tech talent. Dimon has espoused the merits of in-person collaboration, but support for the RTO plan was scarce among those interviewed by BI.\nAs the March 3 expiration date for hybrid work approaches, Dimon has said he's aware that his hardline stance could push some employees away and is fine with that attrition.\n\"I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,\" Dimon said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.\"\nWhile 70% of the bank's 317,233 employees are already in the office five days a week, technology workers are part of the contingent still working one or two days at home.\nThe battle for technical talent — which tends to be industry-agnostic — was long fought using perks, with companies providing lavish extras like fancy food, massages, and even paid family planning services to keep workers happy and attract new ones. With many of those falling away as companies focus on cost cutting, recruiters say hybrid work is emerging as the strongest benefit a company can offer.\nRyan Mazza, who runs the New York office of the financial-talent search firm Selby Jennings, said he had \"no doubt\" that there would be talent attrition among companies that impose a five-day RTO. \"There will certainly be a competitive disadvantage for those companies,\" he said.\nCompanies with flexible working policies have quickly distinguished themselves from the wave of their competitors pulling employees back to the office. Spotify plastered its message on a Times Square billboard in early January, saying its employees aren't children and it was sticking with remote work. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser maintained her pledge to hybrid work this month, as did the fintech Revolut.\nWelch, the tech operations analyst who triggered Dimon's testy comments, said the town hall roused employees rather than quieted them. The RTO decision has pushed some workers to explore the possibility of a union and organizing a unified response.\n\"People are absolutely emboldened. I don't know fully what that means yet,\" he said.\nJPMorgan declined requests for comment.\nJPMorgan's technology footprint is massive by a few measures. The bank employs about 44,000 software engineers globally who run more than 6,000 applications and manage about an exabyte (1 billion gigabytes) of data. That engine of people, systems, and data has helped the bank bring in record financial results, with its net income rising to $59 billion for 2024.\nThe bank also has big AI ambitions, with Dimon saying he has no intention of losing the AI arms race to disruptors. It has created a robust AI research department led by a former Carnegie Mellon researcher, Manuela Veloso, and has earned the top spot on the Evident AI Index, an independent benchmark for AI adoption and performance in finance.\nMike Mayo, a Wells Fargo analyst who regularly grills Dimon on earnings calls, last year called JPMorgan the \"Nvidia of banking,\" commenting on its tech spend outpacing that of any other bank.\nReputation and prestige only go so far, said Deepali Vyas, the global head of the data, AI, and fintech practice at the headhunting firm Korn Ferry. She said she'd seen other companies fail to hire cloud, data, and AI talent purely because of their return-to-office policies.\n\"The challenge for banks is that top tech talent has options,\" Vyas said, adding: \"If firms insist on a rigid in-office structure without a compelling trade-off, they risk losing talent to more agile, innovation-friendly environments.\" Vyas added that she knew of a very senior-level managing director within JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank who told her they're considering quitting because of the return to office.\nA JPMorgan executive director overseeing data scientists and data engineers, a key hiring area for the bank and its AI ambitions, said he's worried about losing talent to the in-office order.\n\"Taking away a hybrid schedule, I honestly think, shrinks our talent pool even more,\" the executive director said. \"I wonder how many people were already on the fence in comparison to other opportunities but now said, 'Forget this. I don't want to be forced into an office.'\"\nWhile JPMorgan made headlines with its return-to-office policy, remote work has steadily tightened across corporate America. Wall Street bosses such as Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Citadel's Ken Griffin pulled workers back to the office in 2021. Big Tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and AT&T, have more recently piled into the effort.\nSelby Jennings' Mazza said he's already seeing pay demands increase for finance-sector jobs over the industry's return to office. Tech workers who are considering these jobs are demanding $5,000 or $10,000 in added pay to cover childcare or offset commuting costs, he said.\nWhile some JPMorgan employees, including Anthony, are already in talks with prospective new employers, recruiters said they didn't see a mass exodus of talent coming overnight as today's tech job market favors employers.\nDown the line, though, the bank's RTO demands and execution could come back to bite it.\n\"Once that turns, even if the pendulum starts swinging just a little bit the other way, and this includes JPMorgan and all those other guys,\" Korn Ferry's Vyas said, referring to Amazon, Dell, and Salesforce, among others, the top performers \"will be the first people that leave for that benefit.\"\nQuestioning one of the most powerful people on Wall Street has raised Welch's profile within JPMorgan. Welch, who supports network equipment inside Chase branches, joked he's going to have to buy a wrist brace for the number of high-fives he gets walking down the hall. A stranger even gave him a mockingjay pin, a nod to the dystopian \"Hunger Games\" movie series wherein the pin becomes a symbol of rebellion.\nA story about Welch getting fired before the move was rescinded, reported by Fortune, has caught the attention of other employers. He said he'd received multiple job offers in the past week. It's a moot point: \"Why would I want to work somewhere else? Chase is the best,\" he said.\nBut Welch, who works three days a week out of JPMorgan's Polaris campus in Columbus, is still a critic of the firm's plans. One reason is that he advocates for a hybrid schedule for employees like himself who help care for family members.\n\"I live with my mom. She is 68. She can't reach the top shelf,\" Welch said. \"She needs help with stuff, and I'm here to do that, you know? I can turn around and go do a thing and come back to work. Why wouldn't I want to do that?\"\nHome to more than 19,000 employees across 13 buildings, Polaris also boasts the fourth-highest-grossing Starbucks. The campus has been key to several tech initiatives, like overhauling its deposit system on the public cloud and developing edge cloud computing for faster data analysis.\nEmployees BI talked to said that offices didn't have enough desks, parking, or conference rooms and that office cafés wouldn't be ready for the increased RTO traffic.\nIn the January memo about the call back to the office, the bank's operating committee acknowledged that not all office locations would be ready for the March 3 deadline and said more information would be shared by the end of the month. The committee added that some offices had capacity restraints and timelines for those would become available on a location-by-location basis.\nBut as of late February, many workers said they were still waiting for an update. For example, Polaris-based staff have yet to be told when they'll be called into the office.\nThe \"messaging feels rushed and unplanned,\" the data executive director said.\nMeanwhile, one analyst whose office permanently closed during the pandemic and was designated a fully remote worker has been left in the lurch about whether they'll have a job in March.\n\"I've only been told that it's business as usual until I'm told otherwise. I was, however, advised by my manager as a friend to consider putting feelers out for new roles elsewhere,\" the analyst said.\nDespite these uncertainties, many have been given their marching orders, and some question: What's the point?\n\"Just because you bring people back into the office doesn't mean you're not going to have Zoom calls,\" a software manager in Ohio said. \"The whole collaboration thing is utter bullshit in my mind because I'm still going to be getting on Zoom calls. The only difference is, two of the people I'm on Zoom calls with might be sitting right beside me,\" the technologist, who works with people in Texas and Singapore, said.\nThe aftermath of the RTO rollout has stoked a fire within some JPMorgan employees to unionize.\n\"They anticipated this was coming,\" Nick Weiner told BI about JPMorgan employees' RTO expectations. Weiner is a senior campaign lead for Communications Workers of America who has led the effort of some 25 Wells Fargo branches in unionizing. He told BI that he had been in touch with JPMorgan workers for a similar effort.\n\"The way he did it helped to really put gasoline on this fire,\" Weiner said of Dimon's town hall comments. Dimon has since said that he shouldn't have sworn.\nA petition against the in-office policy has garnered more than 1,700 signatures, and an internal Signal group counts about 200 members. Dimon said in the town hall he didn't care about how many people signed the petition, but that hasn't deterred workers.\nWelch participated in a meeting last week with other JPMorgan employees to learn more about the basics of the unionizing process, not because he dislikes his employer — \"even after cussing at me, I arguably have more respect for him,\" Welch said of Dimon — but because he loves it.\n\"A union is such a difficult thing to kind of even get going, but we love our jobs so much just in general that we're going to do that,\" Welch said. \"We want to be heard. And these draconic orders are so unlike what we've worked in. It's so unlike what we've dealt with.\"\nHave a tip?

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nBy Caroline Valetkevitch\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Analysts are turning more cautious on U.S. corporate earnings for the first quarter of this year, with the Trump administration's policies threatening to trigger a global trade war that could undermine economic growth.\nApple, Tesla and Ford Motor are among companies contributing the most to recently lowered estimates for the quarter, along with some insurers, whose projections have been hurt by fires in California early this year, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.\nS&P 500 forecasts for the first quarter of 2025 have fallen by 4.5 percentage points since January 1, the largest downward revision since the fourth quarter of 2023, he said.\nEarnings growth for S&P 500 companies is now seen at 7.7% year-over-year, which would be the lowest since 2023's third quarter and a big decline from 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024, based on Friday's LSEG data.\nWhile a handful of companies have already reported on the quarter, the unofficial start of the first-quarter season is still weeks away.\n\"You know there's this negative bias out there. You just don't know to what degree,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.\nEarnings estimates typically decline in the weeks ahead of a new reporting period as companies guide more conservatively, but the majority of companies often go on to beat those lowered expectations.\nFears that import tariffs and retaliation by U.S. trade partners, along with government cutbacks under President Donald Trump in the first months of his second term, might push the economy into recession have increased in recent weeks.\nOn March 13, the S&P 500 confirmed it is in a correction by ending down more than 10% from its February 19 record high close.\n\"A lot of people are worried about things like tariffs ... Really, it's a broad economic slowdown that is the one thing that would be very difficult for companies to contend with,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\nSome investors have hoped that first-quarter earnings could provide a catalyst for gains in the market after the sharp selloff. The S&P 500 is still trading at a multiple of 21 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, based on LSEG data.\nApple on January 30 reported earnings for the quarter ended December 28 that beat analysts' expectations, but iPhone sales and China revenue for the holiday quarter were weak because of competition in China and a slow rollout of artificial intelligence features.\nOn Thursday, the Information reported, citing sources, that Apple is losing more than $1 billion a year on its streaming service Apple TV+.\nTesla sales fell in Scandinavia and France in February from a year ago, according to registration data, as the company faced a brand loyalty test amid CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration's push to cut federal spending.\nEven after a nearly 40% drop in Tesla shares since the start of the year, the stock is trading at more than 80 times forward earnings expectations.\nTesla's earnings per share estimate for the March quarter is down to 47 cents from 70 cents in late January, based on LSEG data.\nFord in February projected up to $5.5 billion in losses on its electric vehicle and software operations this year.\nAutomakers have been in focus, with the White House saying earlier this month that Trump will exempt them from his punishing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month.\nSome analysts see the California wildfires in January as among the costliest natural disasters for insurers. Travelers Companies said in February that it sees $1.7 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses from the wildfires.\nIn the airline industry, shares tumbled recently as Delta Air Lines and others sharply cut earnings forecasts, citing uncertainty about consumer spending.\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Alden Bentley and Nick Zieminski)\nSign in to access your portfolio"

            "full_content": "In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (£80,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs – 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives – like Walmart's equity centre – Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year – 43 – and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book – is DEI dead? – Jolivet says the answer is no.\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\nBut not everyone is reassured.\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Titled “Wu-Tang Forever: The Final Chamber,” the tour is slated to embark early this summer. \nKicking off in Baltimore, Maryland on June 6 for the beginning of their 27-date tour, the iconic hip-hop group will then make its way to Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Seattle, Chicago, New York and Boston before wrapping up on July 18 in Philadelphia, PA. The group will go on tour with the support of hip-hop duo Run the Jewels. Wu-Tang Clan’s founder RZA said of the tour name, “Wu-Tang Clan has shown the world many chambers throughout our career; this tour is called The Final Chamber. This is a special moment for me and all my Wu brothers to run around the globe together one more time and spread the Wu swag, music, and culture. Most importantly to touch our fans and those who have supported us throughout the years.

            "full_content": "The Consumer Financial Protect Bureau (CFPB) on Tuesday dropped its lawsuit against three of the nation’s largest banks due to their handling of the payment service Zelle.\nA court filing from the CFPB stated, “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i), the Plaintiff, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, dismisses this action against Defendants Early Warning Services, LLC, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with prejudice.”\nThe financial regulatory agency, during the late hours of the Biden administration in December, filed suit against Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo for allegedly rushing through its Zelle payment app to better compete against Venmo and CashApp. \nThe Biden-era CFPB believed that these banks failed to “protect consumers from widespread fraud on America’s most widely available peer-to-peer payment network.”\nActing CFPB Director Russell Vought, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has dropped more than a half dozen cases brought on by the Biden-era CFPB director, Rohit Chopra.\nThe agency is now embroiled in a legal battle after a union representing CFPB employees sued to halt mass firings and the purging of data that would’ve happened under Vought and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe CFPB said customers of the three banks have lost more than $870 million since the launch of Zelle in 2017. The service was launched to provide bank customers an alternative to peer-to-peer platforms including PayPal. Last year Zelle crossed $1 trillion in total volumes, which it said was the most ever for a peer-to-peer platform.\nAxios noted that roughly 200 contracts that were reportedly vital to the operations of the CFPB were canceled by the Trump administration.\nBecause the CFPB cases were dismissed with prejudice, the CFPB agreed to never bring these claims to court again.\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

The trip marks the second time in three years that Mr. Trump has attended the NCAA wrestling championships.\nThe president arrived at the South Philadelphia arena to loud cheers and U.S.A. chants as Penn State University looks to close out its fourth straight men's team title.\nClay Travis of Outkick also traveled on Air Force One with the president to attend the event \"as part of the White House new media initiative.\" \nAfter Travis announced his travel plans on social media earlier this week, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt commented on his post, \"See you this weekend!\"\nThe Republican president spent Friday night at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, about 70 miles northeast of Philadelphia, on what was his first visit there of his second term.\n\"We're going to the big fight. The reason I'm going is in Philadelphia. They have the NCAA, world, wrestling for college. And I've always supported the wrestlers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday evening. \"I want to support them. These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools.\"\nOklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin greeted the president as he arrived at the Philadelphia airport. Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan were also at the arena sitting in the same section as Musk and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.  \nThe championships run from Thursday through Saturday and air on ESPN and ESPN+, according to the NCAA. The finals are Saturday at 7 p.m. A free fan experience called Phan-X will be open Friday and Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field. \nMr. Trump attended the 2025 Super Bowl in New Orleans, which the Philadelphia Eagles dominated in a 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. The Eagles are expected to visit the White House on April 28 to celebrate the victory. Mr. Trump was the first sitting president to attend the event.\nThe president also attended the Daytona 500 in February but had to leave before it ended because of multiple rain delays. He has attended college football games and UFC fights as well. \nThe White House said this week it is cutting millions of federal dollars from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump graduated from The Wharton School at Penn in 1968, according to the Daily Pennsylvanian student newspaper.\nWhite House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.\nAs a candidate in 2024, Mr. Trump made frequent campaign stops in Philadelphia. \nMr. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2024 and won five of Philadelphia's 66 wards.\nLaura Fay is a digital content producer at CBS News Philadelphia.

            "full_content": "Thoughts on the Middle East, History and Religion\n© 2025 Informed Comment\nOtherWords 03/16/2025 \nAt Wells Fargo, I saw firsthand how excessive CEO pay harms workers and customers. Congress should use tax policy to rein it in.\n( Otherwords ) – CEO pay has been skyrocketing for years now, fueled in part by tax cuts for corporations and ultra wealthy individuals. That’s not just unfair to ordinary workers or taxpayers — it’s dangerous for our entire economy.\nI’ve seen firsthand how these CEO pay practices incentivize the very worst kinds of corporate misbehavior.\nRemember the 2016 “phony accounts” scandal at Wells Fargo? Executives relentlessly pressured employees to meet extreme sales quotas, leading them to create millions of fraudulent accounts without clients’ consent.\nAs these fake accounts grew, the CEO of Wells Fargo at the time, John Stumpf, raked in bigger and bigger bonuses. After the scandal blew up, regulators hit Stumpf with fines totalling $20 million — only a small dent in the estimated $130 million he walked away with in compensation when he resigned.\nThis is just one of countless stories of CEOs taking reckless actions to pump up their own paychecks while putting their employees and the general public at risk. We’ve seen the same pattern behind the opioid crisis, the 2008 financial crash, the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and more. But it’s the story I know best.\nI started my career at Wells Fargo over 22 years ago — first as a teller, then as a branch manager, and later as an investigator in the department that handles misconduct allegations.\nI would like to be able to say that things changed after the accounts scandal. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo’s current CEO, Charles Scharf, continues to cut corners in ways that put customers at risk.\nLast year, we found out about a plan to cut costs by outsourcing jobs from our investigations department to India, where, in an ironic twist, we reviewed human rights complaints from Wells Fargo employees forced to stay at work even after falling ill. We were concerned not only about losing our jobs but about how this might put our clients’ private information at risk — a particular concern for our many active-duty military clients.\nWells Fargo has also gutted their risk and complaint departments. They use shortcuts to create the illusion of fewer complaints, but in reality they are closing many cases prematurely rather than properly investigating. And, believe it or not, clients are still filing complaints about unauthorized accounts.\nLike Stumpf, Charles Scharf appears to also see his job as a way to further maximize short-term profits to benefit top executives and wealthy shareholders. While slashing thousands of U.S. jobs, Scharf received a compensation package in 2024 worth a staggering $31.2 million.\n “Plutocrat,” Digital, Dream / Dreamland v 3, 2024\nUnder Scharf’s leadership, Wells Fargo also spent over $73 billion on stock buybacks between 2019 and 2023. This is a financial maneuver that artificially inflates executives’ stock-based pay while siphoning resources from worker pay or improving services.\nMy department decided to form a union last year so we would have more power to improve Wells Fargo’s practices. But the bank is still unlawfully refusing to recognize or bargain with our union.\nIt’s time for our political leaders to step up and do something about a CEO pay system that rewards executives with obscenely large paychecks for practices that harm workers and the broader economy.\nThe current tax debate offers a good opportunity. Republicans are calling for even more corporate tax breaks, which, based on past experience, will make the rich richer but do nothing for ordinary working people.\nInstead, Congress should pass bills that have been introduced to tax corporations with huge gaps between their CEO and worker pay and to increase an existing tax on stock buybacks. These bills would encourage companies to focus on long-term prosperity and stability rather than simply making wealthy executives and shareholders even richer.\nIn the meantime, Wells Fargo employees will continue to fight to unionize so they can do their part to make the bank better for the rest of us — the workers, customers, and the communities it serves.\nKieran Cuadras is a former Wells Fargo employee currently working as a family caregiver and union activist in Sacramento, California. This op-ed was distributed by OtherWords.org.\nFiled Under: Corporations, Inequality, Plutocracy \nOtherWords OtherWords is published by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank.

Across more than 30 dates, Maná’s Vivir Sin Aire Tour will visit a total of 21 cities including a residency in at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum that will break the record for most arena shows performed in L.A. history. The band will perform a total of 44 concerts, usurping Bruce Springsteen’s record of 42, according to a press release. Ticket sales begin on Friday, March 14 at 10 a.m. local time via the band’s official website. \n\n\tThis year, Maná became the first Spanish-language act to be nominated to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Their latest tour is named after their 1992 hit. The run will take them to Nashville, St. Louis, Baltimore, Montreal, and Detroit for the first time. A portion of ticket sales will help establish Maná’s Latinas Luchonas program, which, in partnership with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, seeks to empower Latina entrepreneurs with scholarships, mentorship, and leadership opportunities. The program was created in honor of Rosario Sierra, the late mother of vocalist Fher Olvera.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tManá have sold more than 40 million records and earned a combined 12 Grammy and Latin Grammys. On the band solely performing in Spanish, Olvera told Rolling Stone, “We’ve always wanted to keep our music to the language we know and love. I know there are still a lot of stories to tell as Latinos in this globalized, English-focused world.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTrending Stories\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t‘We Are in an Emergency’: Progressive TikTok Star Launches Bid to Unseat Old-Guard Dem\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSean Combs Wins Dismissal of Civil Racketeering Claims in Lil Rod’s Lawsuit\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDropkick Murphys on Musk and Band’s Deactivated Twitter Account: ‘We Broke Up With Him First’\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'We've Got to Start Talking About This': Stephen Graham on Making 'Adolescence'\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManá North American Tour Dates\n\n\tSept. 5 – San Antonio, TX @ Frost Bank CenterSept. 6 – San Antonio, TX @ Frost Bank CenterSept. 11 – Morrison, CO @ Red Rocks AmphitheatreSept. 19 – St. Louis, MO @ Enterprise CenterSept. 20 – Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone ArenaSept. 26 – Chicago, IL @ United CenterSept. 27 – Chicago, IL @ United CenterOct. 3 – Montreal, QC @ Bell CentreOct. 4 – Toronto, ON @ Scotiabank ArenaOct. 10 – Boston, MA @ TD GardenOct. 11 – Baltimore, MD @ CFG Bank ArenaNov. 1 – Dallas, TX @ American Airlines CenterNov. 2 – Dallas, TX @ American Airlines CenterNov. 7 – Phoenix, AZ @ PHX ArenaNov. 8 – Phoenix, AZ @ PHX ArenaNov. 14 – Los Angeles, CA @ Kia ForumNov. 15 – Los Angeles, CA @ Kia ForumNov. 21 – Los Angeles, CA @ Kia ForumNov. 22 – Los Angeles, CA @ Kia ForumDec. 5 – San Jose, CA @ SAP CenterDec. 6 – San Jose, CA @ SAP CenterFeb. 21, 2026 – Detroit, MI @ Little Caesars ArenaFeb. 27, 2026 – Belmont Park, NY @ UBS ArenaFeb. 28, 2026 – Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays CenterMarch 7, 2026 – Philadelphia, PA @ Wells Fargo CenterMarch 20, 2026 – Orlando, FL @ Kia CenterMarch 27, 2026 – Miami, FL @ Kaseya CenterMarch 28, 2026 – Miami, FL @ Kaseya CenterApril 3, 2026 – Atlanta, GA @ State Farm ArenaApril 4, 2026 – Greensboro, NC @ First Horizon Coliseum\nWe want to hear it.

            "full_content": "By \n\n\tDaniel Kreps\n\n\nSwedish papal metal act Ghost will return with a new album, Skeletá, this April, with a newly anointed pope as frontman.\n\n\tAhead of the April 25 release of Skeletá, Ghost’s first album since 2022’s Impera, the band have shared the video for the demonic first single “Satanized,” which also gives fans their first look at Papa V Perpetua, who recently ascended to the Ghost throne following the reign of Papa Emeritus. (All of the pontiffs are, in reality, Tobias Forge, the creative mastermind behind the project, who often assumes different papal personas on new albums.)\n\n\t“We wish to inform you that with just a few plumes of smoke our PERPETUAL state of anticipation has subsided,” the band wrote of the conclave. “We learned patience is key to opening any door in life. Let us celebrate the crowning of Papa V Perpetua and the announcement of Ghost’s six-six-sixth psalm, Skeletá.” The album is available to preorder now.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPapa V Perpetua will make his onstage debut when Ghost embark on their Skeletour World Tour, which includes a North American arena leg.

            "full_content": "Musk, Bezos, and Zuck are going full alpha male. Women are fed up.\nCan you smell the testosterone? Suddenly, America's top CEOs seem to be taking their cues from Logan Roy, Rambo, and, most conspicuously, Donald Trump.\nJiujitsu-fighting, MAGA-fied Mark Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan's podcast to bemoan corporate culture for becoming \"neutered\" and called instead for \"aggression,\" saying \"masculine energy\" is \"good\" and criticism of it had gone too far. Jamie Dimon has gone on f-bomb-filled screeds about how coddled employees need to get back to the office. A buff Jeff Bezos has laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a \"hell yes\" to affirm they're all in on \"personal liberties and free markets.\" Elon Musk, emboldened by Trump to be more \"aggressive,\" is shouting \"chainsaw!\" as he makes brutal cuts to the federal bureaucracy. And even if that Zuck-Musk cage match got canceled, the ready-to-rumble spirit persists: Musk posted to X earlier this month that he \"literally challenged Putin to one-on-one physical combat over Ukraine.\"\nNot in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business.\nI spoke to several female founders, along with psychologists and sociologists, who see the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and the related dismantling of DEI programs, RTO mandates, layoffs, and calls for \"intensity\" — as the onset of a new era of backlash. On the one hand, some women fear that aggressive company culture in the Trump 2.0 era may push them out of corporate positions and continue trends like underrepresentation in the tech sector. On the other, some see it as galvanizing. \"The backlash is a sign that we're making serious progress,\" says Maureen Wiley Clough, the host of \"It Gets Late Early,\" a podcast about ageism in the workplace, sharing the sentiment of several women I spoke to. \"Now we know who these people are,\" she adds. \"The masks and the gloves are off.\"\nWhile some see these displays of strongmanhood as a means of placating — and fending off regulatory action from — the Trump administration, others see it as seizing the political moment to opportunistically return to masculine norms in the workplace. It's \"not about money, it's more about them wanting to have the playground they've always had,\" says Sapna Cheryan, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington. Jennifer Berdahl, a professor of sociology at the University of British Columbia, uses a similar analogy. \"It's like boys in a sandbox but scaling it to billionaires. It's the concept of precarious manhood: Almost no matter how much you succeed, it's just never enough.\" She adds, \"What they're really calling for is for dominance contests to go free, almost like a gladiator arena.\"\nThe gladiator games don't just play out among the top alphas — those down the chain watch and learn. After Musk called a researcher a \"retard\" on X, for example, the use of the slur soon tripled on the platform, a study from Montclair State University found. In a January article titled \"Is corporate America going MAGA?\" an (ironically) anonymous banker told the Financial Times, \"I feel liberated. We can say 'retard' and 'pussy' without the fear of getting canceled.\" Gen Z men are less likely than millennial men to say the term \"feminist\" describes them, according to a 2023 survey from the Survey Center on American Life. Almost half of them said they feel men face discrimination in the US. Meanwhile, only 49% of women feel women in the US are treated with respect and dignity, down from 66% in 2015, a Gallup survey found.\nMany women are fed up. And, tired of waiting on corporate America, they're increasingly building their own arenas.\nOver the past decade, women have made significant, if uneven, gains in the corporate workforce. Women now make up 10.4% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, up from just 4.6% in 2015. The overwhelming majority of this small group is white. Women are now outpacing men in becoming entrepreneurs; today they own nearly 39% of American businesses, increasing the number of women-led companies by 13.6% between 2019 and 2023, a 2024 Wells Fargo report said. Firms owned by men grew by just 7% in the same time period. In Silicon Valley, however, Zuckerberg's \"masculine energy\" quip doesn't track with reality. As of 2022, women made up just 22% of tech workers. That's the same proportion of jobs they held in 2005, the year after Facebook was founded. Women accounted for 16% of first-time VC-backed entrepreneurs and only 9% of entrepreneurs who get VC-backing for two startups, according to a 2024 paper that looked at aggregate data from Pitchbook.\nThe promises of the girlboss era, meanwhile, have come up short. In the 2010s, Sheryl Sandberg called on ambitious women to \"lean in.\" Work hard enough, assert yourself, and you can have it all. But the girlboss was an empty caricature, an updated version of women who'd squeezed their way into the C-suite by engaging in old leadership tactics while wearing high heels. They were feminine and white, often thin and privileged. And, as Michelle Obama famously said of \"leaning in\" in 2018, \"That shit doesn't work all the time.\"\nA sprinkling of female founders and executives in a world run by men hasn't transformed it: Toxic workplaces still emerged at several women-led companies. Steph Korey of Away was outed as a Slack bully (she apologized). Glossier workers reported discrimination and mistreatment under founder and former CEO Emily Weiss' tenure (Weiss apologized, too). Elizabeth Holmes lied to investors and risked lives (she apologized, and is serving an 11-year prison sentence). Sandberg herself is facing new allegations of toxic behavior: A new memoir by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former policy director at Facebook (now Meta), claims that Sandberg had a young assistant sleep in her lap and demanded the author join her in bed on a private jet. The book, \"Careless People,\" also highlights the ways women at Facebook felt leadership had failed them. Meta has slammed the book as inaccurate, calling it a \"mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives.\" A spokesperson for Sandberg's Lean In organization declined to comment on the memoir but directed me to its website for information about ways Lean In sees itself as evolving to help women of all backgrounds navigate barriers and biases they may face at work.\nWomen have proved they can behave just as badly as men — but even when they're on their best behavior or make minor missteps, they're hit with harsh criticism men are more likely to evade. A 2020 study from the Stanford Graduate School of Business found that men are more valued than women when they \"take charge.\" The \"founder mode,\" hands-on, direct style of management can backfire for women — as Airbnb CEO and founder mode proselytizer Brian Chesky posted on X last fall: \"Women founders have been reaching out to me over the past 24 hours about how they don't have permission to run their companies in Founder Mode the same way men can. This needs to change.\"\n\"Even if you have more women, they'll still assimilate to the workplace culture you have,\" says Erika Lucas, the founder of StitchCrew, a nonprofit focused on fostering equitable entrepreneurship, and VEST, a women's peer network and investment fund. \"Women are being conditioned to fit into this meritocracy, or fit within these toxic systems because that's all we have.\" As Cheryan puts it, \"masculine defaults\" are diffuse in the workplace \"because men made companies in their image. The return of those defaults is pushing more women to ditch corporate America and go out on their own, says Lucas. \"The reason why we're seeing more women-led companies starting is because corporate America is not working for women.\"\nWhen companies won't offer work-from-home policies or the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. \"Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself,\" says Jaclyn Pascocello, the founder of Fabrik, a networking space for people to grow their communities, noting that it's still not easy to launch a company. But in this climate of ascendant machoism, she says, she is seeing a collective of women coming together at Fabrik and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. Those can include solutions for women's health and caregiving. \"It really feels like there's a ton of women trying to lift each other up,\" she says.\nBut oversimplifying \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" traits to fit narrow boxes \"is doing everyone a disservice,\" says Ashley Rose, the cofounder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Living Security. \"You need to find people that possess the traits that work well in your culture.\" Similarly, the concept of DEI has been misrepresented and turned into a dirty acronym by the political right, says Virginia Cumberbatch, a global DEI strategist and consultant. While DEI implementation has been lacking and its results disappointing at some firms, there are ways for new and old companies to create initiatives to foster diversity, even in the current political climate. \"We've allowed DEI to be a catchall that's kind of lost its meaning,\" Cumberbatch says. DEI, she says, shouldn't be thought of as a blanket fix. Equity looks different in the work of a university than in an architecture firm. And companies that are serious about building diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments need to give authority to the people in charge of those initiatives. \"It has to be pervasive in every dimension of your organization or your brand, or it is just rhetoric,\" she says.\nThere's no business case for stifling diversity. Many studies have found that having a diverse staff is good for companies financially, and benefits like extended parental leave, caregiving resources, and flexibility help with employee retention and burnout. And Big Tech businesses have ballooned in value while they publicly called for diversity, but they ride the tides of public opinion. Personalities that are power-obsessed often swing politically to hold onto their prestige. With that reality exposed, some women are changing their responses. Vanessa Jupe, the founder of Leva, a platform to support new parents, says she became more politically active in the 2024 election and supported Kamala Harris' campaign by canvassing her neighborhood and donating money. Some Facebook groups dedicated to campaigning for Harris have morphed into places of action, with members organizing to write letters and calling lawmakers to express frustration with the Trump administration. Escalating tactics could include strikes, sit-ins, picketing, and actions like the late February economic blackout that targeted large retailers. \"There's a full-frontal assault on women and people of color,\" Jupe says. \"The time to play nice is not now. You cannot have kid gloves on when you're fighting against really silly bullies.\"\nThe era of the girlboss is long dead. No singular trope or central figure has taken its place in 2025 — which may be a good thing. \"Nobody should be made into a hero,\" Lucas says. \"My hope for women is that we start building power collectively.\" That also means pushing for change by showing that companies can be \"successful because you actually operate it in a different way,\" Cheryan says. Women have stopped thinking they can \"have it all\" by leaning in, and instead are calling on men to do more at home and work toward more equitable workplaces — and opting out of marriage and traditional corporate America if they don't.\nLeaders who are willing to disrupt corporate culture norms have an enormous opportunity to lure top talent away from workplaces that aren't. We're not likely to see a few women rising through the ranks and joining the boys onstage in a cage match — and that's for the best, but there's a culture shift unfolding that could allow them to make something new.\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires.\nDividend stocks have been overshadowed in the market as tech and AI-related equities have surged to record levels. However, Ned Davis Research suggests that a more challenging macroeconomic environment this year could create favorable conditions for dividend stocks to gain traction.\nWith concerns over economic growth and uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff policies, investors have been looking for defensive strategies. In this context, dividend stocks have performed well, providing a safe haven while offering attractive passive income opportunities. The Dividend Aristocrat index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by nearly 5% in 2025, as compared to a 0.32% decline in the broader market, as of the close of March 3.\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Affordable Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\nCompanies that consistently pay dividends are often viewed as stable investments due to their reliable cash flows and financial strength. These firms typically operate in non-cyclical sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, making them less susceptible to economic downturns and helping investors mitigate portfolio risks. At the start of 2025, heightened concerns about resurgent inflation and stagnating economic growth prompted investors to bolster their portfolios with defensive stocks. This strategic shift aimed to safeguard investments against potential market volatility associated with these economic challenges.\nNed Davis’s Clissold and his team made the following comment on the situation:\n“One would expect that companies that pay dividends are more stable and have lower growth rates. As a result, they should rally less in up markets and decline less in down markets. In other words, they have lower betas than non-dividend-payers. … As a group, dividend-payers have a beta of 0.99 versus 1.11 for nonpayers.”\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth of dividend stocks, largely due to anticipated increases in free cash flow (FCF). FCF represents the cash a company has remaining after covering its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This surplus is crucial for corporate boards when deciding on capital allocation strategies, such as enhancing dividend payouts or initiating stock buyback programs. Ameriprise Financial projects a continuous rise in FCF growth through 2027, suggesting that companies with substantial FCF are likely to expand their dividend distributions and share repurchase initiatives in 2025.\nThe report further mentioned that typically, mature companies—those beyond their initial growth phases—and businesses benefiting from significant economies of scale or operating in less capital-intensive industries generate higher levels of FCF. Sectors such as communication services, consumer staples, and information technology often exhibit elevated FCF, positioning them well for potential increases in shareholder returns.\nIn dividend investing, investors often favor companies that have consistently increased their payouts. BMO suggested that dividend growth stocks can help strengthen portfolios during periods of market volatility while enhancing overall returns. The firm emphasizes that a dividend growth strategy targets stocks that offer both yield and growth potential, as these companies generally demonstrate a track record of stable earnings and cash flow. Over the long term, such attributes tend to be valued by investors.\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s Q4 2024 proprietary database of billionaires’ stock holdings and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that group, we picked the top 25 stocks with at least 2% dividend yields, as of March 3. All of these billionaires are founders or managers of some of the top hedge funds in the world.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of bankers in suits, discussing the success of the company's banking products.\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 18\nDividend Yield as of March 3: 2.05%\nWells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is a California-based multinational financial services company. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $20.3 billion, reflecting a modest 0.5% decline from the same period the previous year. However, net income saw a significant jump, rising to $5.07 billion from $3.4 billion a year earlier. This improvement was largely driven by a 15% year-over-year increase in fee-based revenue, which helped offset the expected decline in net interest income. In addition, operating expenses were lower than the previous year, while credit trends remained stable. The company also maintained a strong capital position, ending the year with a CET1 ratio of 11.1%.\nWhile consumer banking continues to be Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC)’s primary revenue source, its investment banking segment has become an important growth driver. In the latest quarter, investment banking fees surged by 59% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, the company’s stock has climbed by over 38%.\nOn January 28, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, maintaining the same payout as the previous quarter. With a history of uninterrupted dividend payments since 1988, the company remains one of the best dividend stocks. As of March 3, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.05%.\nOverall, WFC ranks 5th on our list of best dividend stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential for WFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\nDisclosure: None.

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nLike many industries, the banking industry is dominated by a few major players — and in the U.S., those players are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. The Big Four had a combined $8.8 trillion in consolidated assets as of Q4 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the next four biggest banks had a combined $2.3 trillion.\nI’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nLearn More: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle\nChase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America all boast strong retail banking operations based on their national reach and number of branches. Citi has a much smaller branch count and operates them in only about a dozen states. In this respect, Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are the closest rivals from both a business and investment standpoint.\nIf you want to buy shares of Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC), the first thing you’ll want to know is how their stocks are performing. Like the stock market in general, big bank stocks have gotten off to a rough start this year.\nShares of Chase were down 3.85% year-to-date as of March 11, 2025. Wells Fargo had slipped 2.29% over the same period, while Bank of America suffered a 9.47% decline. The picture is brighter if you look over the longer term, however. Over the past year, Chase’s stock price has risen 21%, Wells Fargo is up about 19% and Bank of America has gained 11%.\nIn terms of share prices, Chase has the priciest stock at about $230 a share, Wells Fargo trades near $65, and Bank of America has the cheapest stock at about $40.\nSo which big bank stock is the best to buy right now?\nWells Fargo seems to be the popular pick among analysts and investment pros. GOBankingRates contacted two experts to get their take.\nAnthony Grosso, a New York-based financial strategist and mortgage loan originator, told GBR that Wells Fargo is “better suited as a buy” than the other big banks.\n“They have a bigger domestic banking focus, which limits the international risks, currency fluctuations, trade wars, etc.,” he said. “They have strong retail branches and have been actively cutting costs and consolidating, while [Chase] and [Bank of America] have been more aggressive in expanding — something that can drag on earnings if the market shifts.”\nHe also considers Wells Fargo a safer pick in terms of stock market volatility because it has a smaller investment banking footprint than the others.\n“The same goes for corporate credit risk and leveraged loans,” Grosso added. “Overall, Wells Fargo is the safer choice, and offers more stability for the unexpected.”\nEdward Corona, a Florida-based trader and publisher of The Options Oracle Newsletter, told GOBankingRates that while all three stocks are in a “downtrend,” Wells Fargo has the “best setup of the three.” Chase is the “weakest of the group,” he said, while Bank of America is “still weak, but not as bad” as Chase.\n“[Wells Fargo] is oversold, but more stable than [Chase] and [Bank of America],” Corona added. “Their relative strength is holding up better, showing it’s performing better than its peers. Support near $65 seems to be holding, and buyers are starting to step in. If I had to pick one, Wells Fargo looks like the best bet. It has better relative performance, solid support, and a more stable technical setup compared to [Chase] and [Bank of America]. If the banking sector rebounds, Wells Fargo has the strongest technical setup to benefit.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying\n3 Changes That Could Be Coming to Social Security Now That Congress Is Republican\n5 Cities You Need To Consider If You're Retiring in 2025\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Chase, Bank of America or Wells Fargo — Which Big Bank Stock Is a Buy?\nSign in to access your portfolio"

These suits (along with the one against Capital One), were filed under former CFPB director, Rohit Chopra, who was fired by Trump two weeks after Inauguration Day.\nA court filing dated 27 February confirmed that the CFPB voluntarily dismissed the Capital One case, two weeks after the Trump administration shut down the agency’s headquarters and significantly halted its activities.\nJonathan McKernan, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) board member and Trump's nominee to permanently head the CFPB, also testified during his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. According to a federal court motion filed on 24 February, the Trump administration intends to maintain the CFPB's operations, though in a more streamlined capacity.\nCreated in 2011 under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has historically fined banks for actions such as creating bank accounts for customers without their knowledge, and for imposing excessive overdraft fees.,\nOperating as an independent government agency for consumer protection in the financial sector, notable CFPB efforts include:\nWelcome to Finextra.

            "full_content": "Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen multiple articles talking about how the new Trump administration plans to cut budgets and the CFPB is not being spared either. The CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) is now dropping lawsuits against major credit card issuers. The lawsuit alleged fraud while handling Zelle payments.\nAs per CNBC, before the Trump administration took over in January, the CFPB had sued Early Warning Services back in December. The lawsuit alleged that the company had failed to properly investigate and reimburse fraud related complaints. The fraud related complaints were pertaining to peer-to-peer payments transfers networks like Zelle.\nThe CFPB “dismisses this action against Defendants Early Warning Services, LLC, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with prejudice,” the regulator said in its filing.\nThe lawsuit refers to complaints from customers of three banks, namely JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. As per the CFPB, customers have lost over $870 million since the launch of Zelle in 2017.\nAlso, the cases were dismissed with prejudice, with the federal agency shutting the door for possible clawback of lost funds.\nSince the recent cases were dismissed with prejudice, the CFPB has agreed to never bring these claims again, shutting off the possibility of clawing back funds for consumer relief, former head of enforcement Eric Halperin told CNBC last week.\nJP Morgan and the Consumer Bankers association also welcomed the judgment.\nA JPMorgan spokeswoman said that while “banks play a crucial role in scam prevention and consumer education…. this is a national security problem that requires a collective effort across the public and private sectors.”\nIt’s no surprise that a spokesperson for Zelle welcomed the judgment. After acting director Russell Vought took over from Rohit Chopra, the going hasn’t been smooth for the agency. A union representing the agency’s employees has already sued the agency. The lawsuit pertains to the mass layoffs owing to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), run by Elon Musk.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \nNever miss out on the deals, news and travel industry trends.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stands against other stocks that Wall Street is calling bullish amid market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500 is down 8.6% in a month while the Nasdaq has lost nearly 13%. Markets continue to scare retail investors as stock after stock struggles to deal with the aftermath of Donald Trump’s unpredictable and aggressive policies.\nWhile it is advisable to stay out of the market till the dust settles, one also can’t deny that it is times like these that bring opportunities. We decided to come up with a list of stocks that are expected to go up even in the existing gloomy environment.\nTo come up with the list of 10 stocks that Wall Street is bullish on, we looked at stocks that were recently upgraded by analysts and have performed well in the last 5 days of trading.\nA team of bankers in suits, discussing the success of the company's banking products.\nWells Fargo & Company is a financial services company. The company operates in Commercial Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, Consumer Banking and Lending, and Corporate and Investment Banking segments. The stock is down 11% in a month and investors are pounding on the opportunity, especially considering the 2.25% dividend yield.\nWFC was also upgraded to Outperform from Sector Perform, mainly because of the recent dip in stock price. But that’s not all. The company’s $1.95 trillion asset cap, which was placed in 2018 by the Federal Reserve, is expected to be lifted soon as it has succeeded in satisfying the regulatory authorities. This could unlock greater profitability down the road:\n“Once the asset cap is lifted, we believe WFC should be able to execute on its future growth plans to achieve its 15% ROATCE target, which should result in a higher valuation over time”\nOverall, WFC ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Wall Street is calling bullish amid market turmoil. While we acknowledge the potential of WFC as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

But, with just 30 seconds on the clock, Hendrickson flipped the script, snatching Steveson’s leg and powering through for a three-point takedown.\nClinging tight, he stunned the Olympic champ to steal the lead and clinch the Heavyweight crown in one of the wildest finishes ever.\nCheckout the insane upset below:\n\"WYATT HENDRICKSON JUST BEAT GABLE STEVESON!!!!!\" #NCAAWrestling x   ESPN/ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/3y22fGCUHw\nMat-side announcer Mike Couzens — alongside former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) two-division champion, Daniel Cormier — dubbed it, “the biggest upset in NCAA history” ... and he might be right.\nU.S. President, Donald Trump, was in attendance for the crazy upset and was saluted by Hendrickson, a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force.\nWhat an awesome moment:\nWyatt Hendrickson — a second lieutenant in the @usairforce — salutes President Donald J. Trump after winning an @NCAAWrestling national championship    pic.twitter.com/KK4ngwH7mW\nFresh off a fizzled WWE stint and a quick exit from NFL’s Buffalo Bills, Steveson returned to Minnesota for his final collegiate run three years removed from winning NCAA’s Heavyweight crown back in 2022. Hungry for another national title to cap his ridiculous legacy, Steveson used his COVID-19 year of elgibility to make one final run.\nThat dream, obviously, crashed hard tonight.\nIn a gut-punch moment, Steveson, 24, called it quits on college wrestling, leaving his shoes on the mat as a symbolic farewell.\nNo words can describe this moment.  ESPN#NCAAWrestling x @GopherWrestling x @GableSteveson pic.twitter.com/HDXkiVtLHh\nEven though he lost tonight, Steveson will go down as one of the greatest wrestlers in NCAA history and an Olympic champion.\nSteveson has teased a move to mixed martial arts (MMA) after his college career, so after tonight, that cage door might swing back open sooner than later.\nNext stop, Contender Series?\nNevertheless, checkout some other reactions from social media:\nFrom failed WWE star, failed NFL Player,  then deciding to go back to college and just to lose in the NCAA championship matchThis be might be a generational all time bad run for Gable Stevenson pic.twitter.com/bhEuMlyb3R\nCongrats to Wyatt Hendrickson of Oklahoma State for doing the impossible…. by beating Olympic Gold Medalist Gable Stevenson of the U of Minnesota at the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Wrestling Championships in Philadelphia. This could very well be the biggest upset since Dan Gable lost…\nNothing but respect for Gable Stevenson, but maybe now you motherfuckers will understand how good Kyle Snyder was and is.\nGable hadn’t lost in YEARS.

The NCAA granted an eligibility waiver because of the COVID-19 pandemic back in 2020, which Starocci used to cap his illustrious PSU career with a fifth title at the new weight class.\nDespite the triumph, Starocci was furious about wrestling the first match of the night, venting to reporters afterward.\n“I was the first match up,” Starocci said. “I’m not sure why ESPN elected for the 184-pound match to be the first one. You’ve got a guy going for his fifth title, and you have the reigning champ [Parker Keckeisen of Northern Iowa]. I think whoever wins that match is the Hodge Trophy winner.\n“We’ve been dominant all year, and you put that match first?” he added. “ESPN, whatever, just makes me laugh and giggle because of some rules that wrestling has in place — things like that — it’s no surprise why wrestling isn’t mainstream.\n“I think you have to look yourselves in the mirror and ask yourselves questions,” Starocci concluded.\nMeanwhile, fellow Penn State alum and UFC Middleweight, Bo Nickal, saw Starocci’s leadoff spot as ideal.\nHere’s an idea for running an event… start the night with your most exciting, most anticipated match! Then build to your least competitive match at the end. The ufc and other sporting events do it wrong. Have your best match of the event on the prelims!

The UFC and other sporting events do it wrong.\n“Have your best match of the event on the prelims! Smart,” Nickal concluded.\nUnfortunately for Nickal, his opinion aged like milk because Gable Steveson suffered the biggest upset in wrestling history during the final match of the evening (watch highlights).\nWith his legendary college career now complete, Starocci has repeatedly hinted at a shift to mixed martial arts (MMA).\nTo checkout the latest grappling-related news and notes click here.\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

            "full_content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dismissed another Biden-era lawsuit, this one targeting some of the world’s largest banks for allegedly rushing out a peer-to-peer payment network that then allowed fraud to proliferate.\nThe agency dropped the case against JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. along with the parent company of the consumer payment network Zelle with prejudice, meaning it cannot be reopened, according to a filing Tuesday in US District Court for the District of Arizona.\nThe lawsuit, filed at the end of last year, alleged that the banks’ lack of safeguards fostered “a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” The banks said they disagreed with the action at the time.\nA spokesperson for Zelle said it welcomed the decision. “As we’ve said before, this lawsuit was without merit, and legally and factually flawed,” the spokesperson said.\nThe consumer protection agency has yanked a bevy of lawsuits filed against financial services companies during former President Joe Biden’s term. Cases against Capital One Financial Corp. and a unit of Rocket Cos. as well as one against fintech lender SoLo Funds were dropped last month.\nThe change in enforcement approach is taking place before President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the agency is confirmed. Jonathan McKernan, who formerly served as a Republican member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. board, testified that he would follow the CFPB’s statutory obligations, which includes the enforcement of some consumer protection laws.\nThe consumer watchdog, established in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, picked up its regulatory and enforcement speed under the Biden administration. It has been essentially shuttered since early February, when Trump administration officials began suspending its work overseeing financial companies and closing its Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nTopics\nLawsuits\nUSA\nFraud\n\nWas this article valuable?\nThank you!

We can’t wait to make this our biggest, most unforgettable tour yet.”\n\n\tThe Jonas20: Living the Dream tour — which will also feature sets dedicated to the music of Nick Jonas & the Administration, Nick Jonas’ solo career, Joe Jonas’ solo work, and DNCE — will begin August 10 at East Rutherford, New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium before moving on to nine baseball stadiums, including Boston’s Fenway Park, Chicago’s Wrigley Field, and Los Angeles’ Dodger Stadium.\nA post shared by Jonas Brothers (@jonasbrothers)\n\n\tAfter that, the tour will go inside with a lengthy arena trek that starts Sept. 18 in Vancouver and currently runs through Nov. 14 at Uncasville, Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun Arena. Over the course of the trek, Marshmello, the All-American Rejects and Boys LIke Girls will serve as opening acts.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tEarlier this week, the brothers — who are holding their JonasCon this weekend at an entertainment complex near MetLife Stadium — revealed that they would kick off their trek in their home state. “Our journey began in New Jersey, it’s where we grew up,” Nick said on Good Morning America. “Joe mentioned riding up and down the East Coast in a trailer. Just really humble beginnings playing in malls, because we couldn’t sell tickets ourselves, and we’d pop up in there and play.”\n\n\tKevin added that their younger selves, who performed in that same mall nearly two decades ago, “would have laughed” at being told they would make it to the MetLife Stadium stage. “Now we’re sitting here being able to play these venues and see our fans that have supported us for so many years,” he said. “It’s just incredible.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTrending Stories\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t‘We Are in an Emergency’: Progressive TikTok Star Launches Bid to Unseat Old-Guard Dem\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSean Combs Wins Dismissal of Civil Racketeering Claims in Lil Rod’s Lawsuit\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDropkick Murphys on Musk and Band’s Deactivated Twitter Account: ‘We Broke Up With Him First’\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'We've Got to Start Talking About This': Stephen Graham on Making 'Adolescence'\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tEditor’s picks\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTo celebrate their 20th anniversary, Jonas Brothers released their latest single “Love Me to Heaven,” with a new album also planned \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonas Brothers Tour DatesAug 10 – East Rutherford, NJ – MetLife StadiumAug 12 – Washington, DC – Nationals ParkAug 14 – Philadelphia, PA – Citizens Bank ParkAug 17 – Hershey, PA – Hersheypark StadiumAug 21 – Toronto, ON – Rogers CentreAug 23 – Boston, MA – Fenway ParkAug 26 – Chicago, IL – Wrigley FieldAug 28 – Detroit, MI – Comerica ParkAug 31 – Arlington, TX – Globe Life FieldSep 6 – Los Angeles, CA – Dodger StadiumSep 18 – Vancouver, BC – Rogers ArenaSep 20 – Portland, OR – Moda CenterSep 22 – Seattle, WA – Climate Pledge ArenaSep 25 – San Francisco, CA – Chase CenterSep 26 – Sacramento, CA – Golden 1 CenterSep 28 – Phoenix, AZ – PHX ArenaOct 2 – Denver, CO – Ball ArenaOct 4 – Omaha, NE – CHI Health CenterOct 5 – Des Moines, IA – Wells Fargo ArenaOct 7 – Kansas City, MO – T-Mobile CenterOct 8 – St. Louis, MO – Enterprise CenterOct 10 – St. Paul, MN – Xcel Energy CenterOct 12 – Milwaukee, WI – Fiserv ForumOct 14 – Nashville, TN – Bridgestone ArenaOct 16 – Tulsa, OK – BOK CenterOct 17 – Austin, TX – Moody CenterOct 18 – San Antonio, TX – Frost Bank CenterOct 19 – Houston, TX – Toyota CenterOct 22 – Tampa, FL – Amalie ArenaOct 24 – Sunrise, FL – Amerant Bank ArenaOct 26 – Orlando, FL – Kia CenterOct 28 – Atlanta, GA – State Farm ArenaOct 29 – Raleigh, NC – Lenovo CenterNov 1 – Lexington, KY – Rupp ArenaNov 2 – Indianapolis, IN – Gainbridge FieldhouseNov 4 – Knoxville, TN – Thompson-Boling ArenaNov 5 – Charlotte, NC – Spectrum CenterNov 6 – Columbia, SC – Colonial Life ArenaNov 8 – Columbus, OH – Schottenstein CenterNov 9 – Buffalo, NY – KeyBank CenterNov 11 – Cleveland, OH – Rocket ArenaNov 12 – Pittsburgh, PA – PPG Paints ArenaNov 14 – Uncasville, CT – Mohegan Sun Arena\nWe want to hear it.

The return journey from St. Helena to Johannesburg is nonstop.\nAirlink also operates a limited seasonal nonstop service from Cape Town International Airport (CPT) to HLE on a handful of Christmas and New Year's dates.\nWith only weekly service available for most of the year, passengers should be prepared for a 60-minute or one-week visit to this remote island.\nRound-trip cash fares in economy class are usually around $1,000 per person. You could also redeem 36,000 Qatar Airways Privilege Club Avios plus 4,383.75 South African rand (about $237) in fees, taxes and surcharges. Unlike United's MileagePlus program, Privilege Club shows economy award seats available on this route.\nRedeeming Qatar Avios to St. Helena would give you a redemption value of almost 2.1 cents each, far higher than our February 2025 valuation of 1.4 cents each.\nAvios are one of the easiest currencies to earn, with more transfer partners than United MileagePlus. You can earn Qatar Avios by transferring Citi ThankYou Rewards points to Qatar Airways Privilege Club. Points transfer to Qatar at a 1:1 ratio.\nAlternatively, you can transfer Capital One miles, Chase Ultimate Rewards points, American Express Membership Rewards points, Bilt Rewards Points and Wells Fargo Rewards points to British Airways Executive Club at a 1:1 rate. Link your British Airways account to your Qatar Airways account, and the combined Avios balance will show in both, allowing you to book Airlink via Privilege Club.\nRelated: 5 versions of Avios: When to use Aer Lingus, British Airways, Finnair, Iberia and Qatar Airways\nVisiting the remote St. Helena Airport is truly a once-in-a-lifetime AvGeek experience. Cash fares have traditionally been high at $1,000 round-trip in economy, and award availability is currently unavailable when redeeming United miles.\nThe new partnership with Qatar Airways Privilege Club means anyone with Avios can book flights to and from St. Helena. Thanks to the number of programs that have adopted Avios (and the mechanism to move Avios from program to program), this currency is easy to earn and redeem.\nThe Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach.

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nThe U.S. market remains volatile due to shifting domestic and foreign policies under President Donald Trump’s new administration. Investors are still concerned about the impact of new tariff policies on inflation and the domestic economy. However, Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment that the Fed is still committed to its initial revised guidance of two rate cuts in 2025 to lower interest rates by a half-percentage point brought some relief.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February after rising 0.5% in January, much cooler than expected. On an annual basis, CPI dropped 2.8% from 3% in January. Retail sales grew solidly despite worries over economic slowdown and rising inflation. Retail sales increased by 0.2% in February, better than the downwardly revised decline of 1.2% in January. As per a report by the University of Michigan, preliminary consumer sentiment for March decreased to 57.9 from 64.7 reported in February. As anticipated, The Federal Open Market Committee has kept the key interest rate unchanged in the range of 4.25-4.5% in its last meeting.\nAmid such uncertain market conditions, mutual fund investing can help those who wish to diversify their portfolio among various asset classes but lack professional expertise in managing funds.

            "full_content": "Senior Contributor. \nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order March 20, 2025 to start dismantling the ... More Department of Education. By law, the Education Department — created in 1979 — cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress, and Republicans do not have the votes to push that through. (Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe federal student loan system is in crisis, and advocates for borrowers are warning that the situation will likely get even worse for those in repayment and for borrowers pursuing student loan forgiveness, following President Donald Trump’s executive order on Thursday calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be eliminated. The order also suggested that the federal student loan system should be privatized.\nMillions of borrowers, particularly those in income-driven repayment plans or who are pursuing student loan forgiveness, are currently facing major challenges. The SAVE plan, a Biden-era repayment program that lowered payments for many, remains frozen as a legal challenge continues, and more than eight million borrowers who had enrolled in the program remain in a forbearance. Earlier this month, the Trump administration effectively shut down the entire income-driven repayment application system, causing a myriad of issues including skyrocketing payments and effectively blocking borrowers from accessing legally required affordable repayment plans, as well as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. A major labor union filed a legal challenge against the administration earlier this week to force the reopening of income-driven repayment applications and PSLF.\nBut borrower advocates are warning that President Trump’s latest move to try to shut down the Department of Education – which comes on the heels of mass layoffs at the department earlier in March – is only going to worsen the situation for borrowers, jeopardizing their access to affordable payment plans and congressionally authorized student loan forgiveness programs. Trump also suggested in the order that the federal student loan system should be effectively privatized. Here’s what borrowers need to know.\nPresident Trump’s executive order on Thursday calls for the closure of the Department of Education. But most legal experts agree that the president has no legal authority to do so. The department was created by Congress, and can only be eliminated by Congress (where there are likely insufficient votes in favor of such a move). The executive order appears to concede this.\n“The Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely,” reads the order. The phrase “to the maximum extend appropriate and permitted by law” may be a tacit acknowledgment that only Congress has the ability to close the department.\nBut another section of the order referencing the student loan system is notable, and suggests that a private entity would be better suited to operating federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. This echoes Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for government reform, which called for a larger private sector role in the federal student loan system.\n“The Department of Education currently manages a student loan debt portfolio of more than $1.6 trillion,” reads the order. “This means the Federal student aid program is roughly the size of one of the Nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo. But although Wells Fargo has more than 200,000 employees, the Department of Education has fewer than 1,500 in its Office of Federal Student Aid. The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America’s students.”\nNotably, Trump’s executive order was issued just a week after the Department of Education cut half of its workforce through mass layoffs and buyouts, which included significant reductions at the Office of Federal Student Aid – in particular the FSA Ombudsman group, and a unit that oversees the department’s contracted student loan servicers. But Congress directed FSA and federal student loan operations to be housed at the Department of Education, and it may not be legally possible to move it to a different entity (federal or private) without congressional authorization. Privatizing the entire federal student loan system would likely also require an act of Congress. The Trump administration appeared to confirm this in a statement yesterday.\n“When it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to reporters on Thursday. “But we don’t need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that’s clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students.”\nBut on Friday, Trump indicated that despite those assurances made only a day prior, the administration would be moving FSA and the federal student loan system to the Small Business Administration.\nBut borrower advocates are warning that the ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to gut the Department of Education will have significant repercussions for student loan borrowers, even if it does not formally close down or its operations are transferred to states or the private sector. And borrowers are already experiencing significant problems after the department effectively shut down the income-driven repayment application system, leaving millions with no way to access affordable payments or pursue federal student loan forgiveness programs like PSLF.\n“Tens of millions of students and families rely on the functioning of federal student aid programs to pay for college and job training programs and to manage their federal student loans,” said Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, in a statement on Thursday. “Recent actions by the Trump Administration to block access to affordable student loan repayment plans and terminate staff in the Student Aid Ombudsman office and offices that oversee student loan servicers are already causing chaos for people trying to pay their student loans. Dismantling the Department of Education will make things much worse, creating new disruptions and costly and frustrating problems for students, borrowers, and their families in every state.”\n“The purpose of the Department of Education is to serve all students and borrowers—not special interests, billionaires, or politicians looking to dismantle vital offices and protections,” said Sabrina Calazans, Executive Director at Student Debt Crisis Center. “The elimination of the Department will harm borrowers seeking relief via essential programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans, leaving millions of families in further financial turmoil. Borrowers have already faced enough confusion and hardship. More chaos and less guidance is not the answer.”\nThe Trump administration is facing an increasing number of legal challenges over efforts to dismantle the Department of Education and block critical federal student loan relief programs.\nThis week, the American Federation of Teachers, a major national labor union, filed a lawsuit against the department for cutting off access to income-driven repayment plans and effectively preventing borrowers from pursuing student loan forgiveness through PSLF. The AFT noted in its complaint that the administration’s decision to take down income-driven repayment applications and halt all processing is happening as “government offices meant to assist borrowers with their loans are being shuttered.”\nEarlier this month, more than a dozen states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a separate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s authority to cut nearly half of its staff.\n“This administration may claim to be stopping waste and fraud, but it is clear that their only mission is to take away the necessary services, resources, and funding that students and their families need,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. James and the other states attorneys general argue that by laying off much of the Department of Education’s staff, the Trump administration will prevent the department from fulfilling legally required obligations as set out in federal laws enacted by Congress.\nThe Department of Education has maintained that all operations, including those related to student loan forgiveness and repayment, will remain intact. The department “will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking,\" said a White House statement announcing the mass layoffs earlier this month."

            "full_content": "Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that.\nQraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR).\nBut this year's volatile market has led the fund — which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market — to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way.\nAMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider.\n\"In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month,\" Tam said.\nA tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date.\n\"Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech,\" Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now.\nInstead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).\nThe AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%).\nEven though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock.\n\"We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development,\" Tam said.\nAs for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker.\n\"We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot,\" Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm.\nAI isn't alone in betting on Tesla — the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick.\nThe bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. \"Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month."

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nUS stocks climbed on Monday, with focus on more mixed economic data ahead of this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained about 0.6% to rebound for a second day in row, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 350 points, or more than 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3% as \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, including Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), faltered.\nThe gauges continued a climb after a sell-off that saw the S&P 500 enter correction territory and the Dow book its worst weekly performance since March 2023. Markets have been buffeted by economic slowdown fears and uncertainty over Trump's unpredictable tariff policy.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent inflamed those worries on Sunday when he told NBC that he's not worried about the recent slump in stocks, saying \"corrections are healthy.\" He added that there are \"no guarantees\" the US will avoid recession.\nOn Monday, rate-cut bets this year rose after a fresh print showed retail sales increased less than expected in February, while January's reading was revised lower.\nMonthly retail sales were up 0.2%, versus estimates of a 0.6% rise, while the previous month's 0.9% drop was revised to a fall of 1.2%.\nMeanwhile, the New York Fed's reading on manufacturing activity in New York state showed a sharp pullback in March, with the headline business conditions index falling to -20 from a reading of 5.7 in February.\nWall Street is also bracing for the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting starting Tuesday, where it is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will look for any sign that Trump's policies are changing the central bank’s views of the future of the economy.\nStocks gained for a second day in a row on Monday as investors turn their attention to this week's Fed interest rate meeting.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) erased earlier losses to gain 0.3% as some tech names slipped. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.6% to gain for a second day in a row after it entered correction territory last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 350 points, or about 0.8%, after registering its worst week since 2023.\nThe Federal Reserve will start its two-day meeting on Tuesday. Investors expect policymakers to announce no change to rates on Wednesday afternoon, but expectation is building for a resumption of cuts this year and possibly more than previously anticipated following weak economic data and a volatile couple of weeks amid tariff uncertainty.\nNearly 11 sectors of the S&P 500 gained on Monday, with Energy (XLE) and Real Estate (XRE) stocks leading the way.\nThe 'Mag Seven' stocks managed to climb off their lows of the session. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) closed the session in negative territory.\nStocks were near the highs of the session on Monday with less than one hour left of trading.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) erased losses from earlier to gain 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up about 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 1.2% after registering its worst week since 2023.\nAll 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were in green territory.\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on Tuesday. Investors expect policymakers to hold rates steady following its two-day meeting. However expectations are rising that Fed officials will need to resume rate cutting this year in order to stimulate the economy, as recent data may be signaling a slowdown.\nEnergy (XLE) and Real Estate (XRE) stocks gained on Monday, sending the major averages higher.\nAll 11 sectors of the S&P 500 rose after weak economic data signaled cracks in the US economy, lifting expectations that the Federal Reserve will need to resume rate cuts this year.\n\"A modest rebound in February retail sales following a downwardly revised plunge in January indicates increased spending reluctance on the part of the consumers as flagging consumer sentiment, rising job insecurity, and another bout of cold winter weather took a toll on households’ willingness to spend,\" EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said on Monday.\nHeadline retail sales rose 0.2% in February, less than the 0.6% increase economists had expected. Retail sales in January were revised lower to a decline of 1.2% from a prior reading that showed a 0.9% decrease in the month.\nInvestors may be betting that a slower economy would prompt Fed officials to start cutting rates again this year. Policymakers will meet on Tuesday, though the market widely anticipates they will hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of their meeting on Wednesday afternoon.\nTesla stock (TSLA) was a Nasdaq laggard on Monday, falling more than 5% on the heels of eight straight weeks of declines.\nShares dropped on news from China, one of the company’s most important regions, that the electric vehicle manufacturer is offering a free trial of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) autonomous software on the mainland.\nPras Subramanian reports:\nThe future of stock market investing isn't the stock market.\nOn Monday, Robinhood (HOOD) announced it was launching prediction markets, allowing users to trade the outcome of events, with this week's Fed meeting and the NCAA tournament serving as the first two markets at launch.\nLast month, readers might recall, the company sought to launch bets on the Super Bowl but later withdrew that plan.\nA month later, it seems the company has the answer for regulators.\n\"The prediction markets hub — and corresponding contracts — will initially be available across the US through KalshiEX LLC, a CFTC regulated exchange,\" the company said in Monday's release.\n\"We have been in close contact with the CFTC over the past several weeks and look forward to continuing to work with them to promote innovation in the futures, derivatives and crypto markets.\"\nSo with the regulatory machinery hammered out and the company finding a better partner for its latest initiative outside of stocks, Robinhood appears to be signaling that the future of stock market investing is actually sports betting.\nAs Bloomberg's Matt Levine wrote back in February:\nThere are two basic mental models one can use when investing in the stock market — no one knows anything or everyone knows everything.\nBoth, taken to their extremes, form a firm backing for doing what most research suggests most people should do with most of their investments: park them in a low-cost index fund and then do something else with their time and talents.\nFor professional investors, both of these models also offer plenty of reasons to go on trying to beat the market. Surely, not everyone can know everything, and someone must know something. Why not us?\nBut for both the retail investor and the companies that serve them, a regularly reinforced message that the best way to do something with your money is to do nothing will eventually see these relationships fall off in both directions.\nCompanies cannot acquire users and count on them to remain customers through years of inaction. And few customers of any business, no matter what they are \"supposed\" to do with the product, will remain as such if there's no reason to remember they're a customer.\nAll of which helps to outline the appeal of prediction markets as a middle ground of sorts.\nThey resolve quickly. They are discrete. And while leverage can be applied to any wager in creative ways, there aren't (at least not yet) options on these derivatives.\nIn its paper arguing for the value of offering prediction market contracts, Robinhood writes, \"The combination of risk mitigation, information aggregation, speculation, and learning potential makes prediction markets a valuable economic and informational tool for businesses and individuals alike.\"\nAnd speaking of things everyone knows, the modern US economy is highly financialized, but most participants are unable to hedge their risk. (As a W-2 employee with a mortgage and a 401(k), I'm actually levered long my local housing market, the online media industry, and the US stock market.)\nSo: does this new product offering change the risk profile for the majority of Robinhood's users, many of whom are likely exposed to the same leverage as this post's author? Probably not.\nBut what it does signal is that the stock market's role in the average person's efforts to improve their financial standing or de-risk their financial assets is likely to decrease over time.\n\"Democratizing\" things like private equity and venture capital fit in this bucket, of course.\nAnd placing a yes/no bet on all 67 games set to be played in the NCAA Tournament doesn't exactly scream \"de-risking.\"\nThe stock market is often discussed as a solved problem — much like baseball, with its three true outcomes — but if the known correct action is, as mentioned above, to buy the basket and do nothing, then both the business strategist and human nature biases toward action must be allayed somehow.\nAt least sports are fun.\nIntel (INTC) stock rose 7.5% Monday after Reuters reported that the chipmaker's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is considering \"significant changes\" to the company's manufacturing and artificial intelligence strategies.\nCiting anonymous sources with ties to Tan, Reuters reported that the new chief executive is looking to restructure Intel's approach to AI and revamp its manufacturing operations by attracting new customers.\nTan's appointment as CEO was announced last week by Intel to the thrill of investors. Shares of the chipmaker jumped 15% on the news.\nIntel has struggled to regain technological dominance in the AI-dominated market. The stock fell roughly 60% in 2024. With Monday's gain, Intel shares are up nearly 30% year to date.\nAnother Wall Street strategist is lowering her year-end target on the S&P 500 (^GSPC), citing economic growth concerns.\nFollowing the S&P 500's recent 10% drawdown, RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina lowered her year-end target to the S&P 500 to 6,200 from 6,600. Calvsina's revised outlook on the S&P 500 comes after both Goldman Sachs and Yardeni Research lowered their targets last week.\n\"While we don’t believe that a pullback beyond the 10% drawdown that has already been sustained is inevitable, we do believe that the path for stocks between now and December has gotten rockier with stronger headwinds,\" Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night.\nA gloomier outlook on US economic growth from the RBC Capital Markets economics team contributed to the more subdued S&P 500 projection. RBC's economic forecasters now project the economy to grow 1.6% this year, down from a prior estimate of 2%. Calvsina noted that the stock market has often fallen in years when GDP is in a \"sluggish\" range of 1.1%-2%.\n\"Some economic forecasters around the Street have started to dial down their 2025 GDP forecasts, but are not calling for a recession,\" Calvasina wrote. \"Historically, the dialing down of economic growth on its own presents a significant headwind for the stock market to overcome.\"\nMonday's early market action featured more pain for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) are all lower on Monday morning. Apple, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia fell more than 1%, while Tesla shares slid over 5%.\nConsequently, the major indexes' attempt at a comeback stalled. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved down nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up less than 0.3% and off its high for the day.\nThis reflects a point that several Wall Street strategists have made to Yahoo Finance in recent days: The stock market's path out of its slump is still likely contingent on the path of the Magnificent Seven megacaps\n\"For the market to go higher from here, you need the broadening thesis to happen, but you need your Mag Seven to contribute,\" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance.\nBMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski echoed Chronert's sentiment about the group's importance.\n\"Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,\" Belski told Yahoo Finance. \"But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.\"\nYahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:\nGuess? shares (GES) surged as much as 27% on Monday after the company announced it received a proposal to go private.\nThe clothing company said its board of directors received a non-binding proposal from WHP Global to acquire the outstanding shares of Guess for $13.00 per share in cash.\nAt 10:55 a.m. ET, shares were trading just above $12 each.\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:\nBuilders are feeling less confident about the housing market as they navigate economic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs, and high housing costs.\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell to 39 in March, down 3 points from February and the lowest level in seven months. According to Bloomberg data, economists were expecting a reading of 42. A reading below 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good.\n“Builders continue to face elevated building material costs that are exacerbated by tariff issues, as well as other supply-side challenges that include labor and lot shortages,” NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a homebuilder and developer from Lexington, N.C., said in a press release.\nPresident Trump last week imposed a 25% tariff on all imported steel and aluminum products, without exemptions or exceptions, a move that could raise housing costs.\n“Construction firms are facing added cost pressures from tariffs,” NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz said in the release.\nDietz noted “Data from the HMI March survey reveals that builders estimate a typical cost effect from recent tariff actions at $9,200 per home. Uncertainty on policy is also having a negative impact on home buyers and development decisions.”\nUS stocks were mixed in early trading on Monday after the release of weak economic data and ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) traded near the flat line, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly.\nWeak economic data appeared to send stocks higher over expectations of Fed rate cuts sooner, rather than later.\nRetail sales rose 0.2% in February, less than the 0.6% expected, while January's 0.9% drop was revised down to 1.2%.\nThe New York Fed's reading on manufacturing activity in New York state showed a sharp pullback this month, with the headline business conditions index falling to -20 from 5.7 in February.\nAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve's meeting this week, though investors expect policymakers to announce they will hold rates steady on Wednesday afternoon.\nNational readings on consumer and business confidence have shown signs of weakness as markets sink and Trump's trade war takes shape, and the regional data isn't much better.\nOn Monday, the New York Fed's reading on manufacturing activity in New York state showed a sharp pullback this month, with the reading's headline business conditions index falling to -20 from 5.7 in February.\nThe index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting lower confidence about conditions from those reporting higher confidence in the business outlook.\nThis reading marks the lowest for the survey since January 2024.\n\"Manufacturing activity dropped significantly in New York State in March,\" said Richard Deitz, economic research adviser at the NY Fed. \"Input price increases climbed for a third straight month to hit their fastest pace in more than two years. In addition, supply availability is expected to contract and firms continued to grow less optimistic about the future business outlook.\"\nThe survey was conducted from March 3-11.\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports:\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose over 1% in premarket, with the kick-off of the chipmaking giant's annual software developer conference just hours away.\nThe stakes are high for Nvidia, whose market cap is nearing $3 trillion thanks to its dominance in AI — which is under threat after DeepSeek upended AI spending hopes with its cheaper chatbot.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nEconomic data: Retail sales (February); NAHB Housing Market Index (March)\nEarnings: No notable earnings releases expected.\nHere are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning:\nTrump's tariffs loom over a still-cautious Fed as markets gyrate\nIreland's profits from weight-loss drugs draw Trump's attention\nA Fed meeting and retail sales data greet a flailing stock market: What to know this week\nTrump: Both reciprocal and sectoral tariffs coming April 2\n'A sentiment shift': What Wall Street is saying after the S&P 500's 10% tumble\nUS meat exports at risk as China lets registrations lapse\nThe 4% rule creator reveals the new safe retirement withdrawal rate\nBig tech stocks at cheapest in months fail to entice wary buyers\nGoldman cuts oil forecasts amid slow US growth, OPEC+ policy\nChina: Global CEOs to meet Xi in Beijing next week\nOil prices have risen for a second consecutive day after China revealed plans to increase oil consumption.\nSign in to access your portfolio"

            "full_content": "A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.\nIn the lead-up to Inauguration Day, all six of the United States’ largest banks backed away from a United Nations-sponsored climate initiative amid attacks from conservative lawmakers and regulators.  \nBank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo left the Net Zero Banking Alliance between December and January in what was perceived to be a concession to right-wing criticism of so-called ESG — decision-making driven by environmental, social, and corporate governance considerations. Nineteen Republican attorneys general had issued “civil investigative demands” to those banks in 2022, demanding that they turn over information about their ESG practices. They argued that the alliance was beholden to “the woke climate agenda” and that it violated antitrust laws.\nWhile the banks’ exodus from the alliance certainly looks like a setback for the banking sector’s climate progress, environmental advocates say it is a reminder that voluntary initiatives have never been sufficient to drive the sector’s decarbonization.\n“There are other levers that we can use to hold banks accountable,” said Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior energy finance campaigner at the nonprofit Rainforest Action Network, which publishes an annual report on how much money banks commit to fossil fuel projects. In light of the Trump administration’s pro-oil and gas agenda, she said that over the next four years, activists and policymakers will have to keep the pressure on and, critically, push for stricter legislation at the state and international levels.\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n“It is quite clear that major U.S. banks will not police themselves,” she added.\nThe Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, launched in 2021 under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative and has about 140 members after the six American banks — and four Canadian ones — exited. The alliance asks member banks to commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across their operations and “lending and investment portfolios” by 2050, and to set intermediary emissions reduction targets for 2030 and every five years thereafter. It also asks banks to disclose their annual emissions, and sets some recommendations to limit the application of carbon offsets toward banks’ climate goals.\nHowever, much like the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, the NZBA relies on voluntary participation and compliance, and does not have any enforcement authority. It’s been criticized for not asking enough from its members, which are allowed to participate even if they continue underwriting the expansion of oil and gas infrastructure. U.N. proposals that would tighten its requirements — particularly around financing of fossil fuels — faced strong opposition from recently departed banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America.\nEven some of the NZBA banks themselves have acknowledged the alliance’s limitations in the face of government inaction. In 2023, Amalgamated Bank’s chief sustainability officer, Ivan Frishberg, told the business publication Responsible Investor that NZBA signatories were “being left alone at the altar” as governments around the world failed to legislate a transition away from fossil fuels. GLS Bank, based in Germany, quit the alliance that same year in protest of other NZBA members’ support for fossil fuel projects in Africa.\nGrist thanks its sponsors. Become one.\nTo support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How\nWells Fargo declined to comment on the rationale behind its departure from the NZBA. Goldman Sachs said it had made “significant progress” on its net-zero goals but did not explain why it left the alliance. The other four recently departed banks did not respond to inquiries from Grist. \nUnlike voluntary initiatives, governments have the authority to ensure that banks live up to their stated climate promises and to push them to do more. At an event in New York City last November — notably, even before the NZBA shakeup — the former deputy secretary to the U.S. Treasury, Sarah Bloom Raskin, suggested that states should take on this role.\nStates “have a unique opportunity to lead,” she said, noting the incoming presidential administration’s hostility to climate action. At the time, California had already passed two laws requiring large businesses, including banks, to report their greenhouse gas emissions annually and disclose their climate-related financial risks biannually. Those laws recently survived a legal challenge from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and New York state lawmakers introduced similar bills in January. A Democratic state representative in Illinois introduced a disclosure bill last month. \nDanielle Fugere, president and chief counsel for the shareholder advocacy nonprofit As You Sow, said disclosure is a prerequisite for holding banks to their climate goals. ”We want to understand what it is they’re doing,” she said. Laws like California’s bring to light the financial instability wrought by fossil fuel-driven climate change and — in theory, at least — discourage financing that would exacerbate it.\nOf course, merely requiring that banks disclose their emissions and climate-related risks isn’t likely to prevent the worst impacts of global warming. According to a landmark 2021 report from the International Energy Agency, no new oil, gas, and coal infrastructure can be built if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s why Patrick McCully, a senior energy transition analyst for the French nonprofit Reclaim Finance, which advocates for a more sustainable banking sector, said legislators should be “pushing the banks to reduce their financing of fossil fuels.” \n“These companies are acting against the interests of humanity, and we need to stop them,” he told Grist.\nFajans-Turner, however, said a policy of this nature would be difficult to write into law and would likely face legal challenges even in the most progressive states, where natural gas bans on new construction have been beaten back by industry groups. \nAnn Lipton, a business law professor at Tulane University, said a better way for policymakers to limit new fossil fuel projects is to look beyond the banking sector. For instance, lawmakers could require insurance companies to factor in climate-related financial risks when designing their policies — which could make it harder for fossil fuel projects to get coverage. “We would love banks to stop financing risky activities, but at the end of the day, the job of a bank is to finance things that are predictably profitable,” she said. “It’s the job of the rest of society to make that [thing] not profitable.”\nAnother strategy is to require that banks publish a clear decarbonization plan, which can, in theory, be a sort of back door to blocking new fossil fuel investments. “Implicit in having a target is that the bank is taking some kind of action to ensure that it meets that target,” Fugere said. If a plan mentions “net-zero” by a certain date, then to be credible it must involve some sort of scaling back of fossil fuel financing. If it claims to align with a pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, then it must not enable the expansion of fossil fuels. \nIn the U.S., investors like As You Sow have pressured several big banks into voluntarily offering more information about their plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but requests for greater detail were rebuffed last year. (At least one bank, Wells Fargo, has done an about-face, recently dropping its net-zero target altogether.) \nLegislation to require detailed decarbonization plans has seen more success on the international stage. The European Union, for instance, is beginning to use two corporate sustainability directives approved by its parliament to require financial institutions to adopt a “transition plan for climate change mitigation.” The laws require institutions to make their “best efforts” to ensure that their plans are compatible with a pathway toward achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C.\nMcCully said these regulations are promising but noted growing opposition to them from right-wing governments in Europe. “We need to defeat that pushback to make sure that legislation is going to be able to survive,” he said. \nEven as they push for stronger government oversight of the banking industry, organizations like the Rainforest Action Network and Reclaim Finance say they plan to continue drawing connections between the financing of fossil fuel projects and the harm these projects may cause to communities — whether directly, because of the risk of oil spills and explosions, or indirectly because of accelerating climate change. Mass demonstrations and research publications like Rainforest Action Network’s annual report can theoretically increase the public’s appetite for state, national, and international regulation.\n“It’s hard to be optimistic,” said Quentin Aubineau, a policy analyst at the nonprofit BankTrack, which does research and advocacy around banks’ role in the climate crisis and human rights violations. “But we have a lot of people working on the ground, doing a lot of research, and putting a lot of effort together to try to make a change. I think we will get there, even if it’s not the best environment to work in at the moment.”\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

(Photo by Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\nWhen the Philadelphia 76ers entered the 2024-25 NBA season, they didn't envision thinking more about top prospect Cooper Flagg and whether they'd retain their first-round pick than the Larry O'Brien Trophy.\nPhiladelphia signed Paul George to a four-year, $211.6 million contract. They retained Kelly Oubre, who became a fan favorite the previous year, his first in the City of Brotherly Love. The Sixers also added Caleb Martin. They even earned positive feedback at the NBA Draft, selecting former Duke Blue Devil guard Jared McCain.\nUnfortunately for the 76ers, after contributing to the United States men's basketball team's gold medal run, Joel Embiid's been plagued by a knee injury that limited him to 19 games this season. In September, the seven-time All-Star signed a three-year, $193 million extension.\nMeanwhile, George, who's on one of the NBA's worst contracts, has only appeared in 41 contests. He's averaging 16.2 points, down from 22.6 in his final campaign with the Los Angeles Clippers. His field goal percentage has plummeted to 43 percent compared to slightly north of 47 percent a season ago. The six-time All-NBA selection, who turns 35 in May, is shooting 35.8 percent from beyond the arc on 6.5 three-point attempts per game.\nAfter a promising start, McCain's season ended in December when the rookie tore his left meniscus.\nPhiladelphia's nightmare year has led to the franchise clinging to the hope of retaining its first-round draft pick. If it falls outside of the top six, it belongs to the kings of draft capital, the Oklahoma City Thunder. Between the Thunder's picks, swaps, and protected selections, like the one the 76ers may convey to them, Oklahoma City has 29 first and second-round choices between now and 2031.\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - DECEMBER 23: Guerschon Yabusele #28 of the Philadelphia 76ers dunks the ...

(Photo by Emilee Chinn/Getty Images)\nBut in a season filled with glum for the Sixers, Guerschon Yabusele has been a bright spot. The former Boston Celtics' first-round pick shined at the Olympics. He replaced Rudy Gobert in France's starting lineup, a move that helped propel the host country to the gold medal game against the United States.\nYabusele's performance earned him a ticket back to the NBA, signing a deal with Philadelphia shortly before training camp. He has since started in 31 games and is producing 10.7 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 2.0 assists. He's also knocking down nearly 40 percent of the 3.8 threes he's hoisting.\n\"First and foremost, he's played very well all year,\" said Sixers head coach Nick Nurse at his pregame media availability before Philadelphia's 123-105 loss to the Celtics. \"He plays very hard. He's a coach's dream, [a] true pro. [He] plays hard every night, [he] is out there almost every night. He's played almost all the games. Great spirit.\"\nThe 76ers' bench also noted of Yabusele, \"We didn't know if he was going to help us at all at the start of the year. He was one of the last guys picked up as we went in there. We did kind of have a need at the roster there, we thought. It's been a lot of positives from him. He's been really awesome.\"\nThe 29-year-old veteran has made such an impression on the Sixers that despite being an unrestricted free agent this offseason, they opted against moving Yabusele at the trade deadline, signaling their desire to re-sign him this summer."

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just hit its lowest valuation since before ChatGPT launched, with its price-to-earnings ratio sliding to levels not seen since 2019. The stock has tumbled 30% from its peak, pushing its forward P/E down to 24x41% cheaper than when AI mania kicked off. But analysts aren't panicking. Melius Research and Wells Fargo both see this as a textbook buy-the-dip moment, citing Nvidia's 788% net income surge since fiscal 2023 and a broader AI boom that's still in full swing. With demand for GPUs holding strong, this sell-off could be setting the stage for another big leg up.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nNext week's GPU Technology Conference is adding fuel to the speculation. CEO Jensen Huang is expected to lay out a roadmap stretching to 2027, covering cutting-edge advancements like co-package optics and the new Blackwell Ultra (GB300) inferencing chip. Investors will also be watching for updates on Nvidia's software monetization, networking upgrades, and automotive expansion. Historically, the stock tends to outperform around GTC, gaining an average of 6.4% during the event and another 4.5% in the two weeks that follow. If that pattern holds, this could be the setup bulls have been waiting for.\nSome analysts are drawing comparisons to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) valuation crunch post-iPhone launch in 2008when skepticism gave way to explosive long-term growth. If Nvidia follows a similar trajectory, today's discounted valuation might not last long. Melius Research holds firm on a $170 price target, while Wells Fargo goes even higher at $185, both implying substantial upside. With AI adoption still in its early innings, investors betting on Nvidia's future might soon look back at this dip as a golden opportunity.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\nSign in to access your portfolio"

(In addition to Graves disease, Williams reportedly has been diagnosed with dementia and aphasia; while she had said in the past that she suffers from substance abuse issues, she told The View today that she no longer drinks except for one birthday celebration last July).\n\n\tShortly after her phone-in appearance to The View cohosts (sans Whoopi Goldberg, who has Fridays off), Sunny Hostin, the panel’s legal expert, read the following statement: “We think it is important to note that her legal guardian now believes it would be prudent for Wendy to undergo a new medical evaluation that will involve comprehensive neurological and psychological testing by a specialist in the field. This would be more thorough testing than what she had mentioned earlier. The judge has agreed to do that. And when we learn more, we will let you know.”\n\n\tWhile Hostin did not name the guardian or judge, Williams’ legal guardian is Sabrina E. Morrissey and the judge in the case is Judge Lisa Sokolof.\n\n\tWilliams’ guardianship was triggered by Wells Fargo bank after the talk show host’s bank account indicated unusual activity. It was later determined that Williams could not care for her finances. Williams has repeatedly disagreed with that assertion.\n\n\tWithout naming the guardian and the judge, Williams told The View, “These two people don’t look like me, talk like me, act like me…you know, get off my neck! I can’t do it with these two people…”\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\n\t\t\tBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

            "full_content": "As the landscape of credit cards and loyalty programs continues to evolve, consumers are increasingly looking for ways to maximize rewards, access exclusive experiences, and make their spending work harder for them. To dive deeper into this space, I sat down with Nick Ewen, Senior Editorial Director at The Points Guy, to discuss credit card trends, loyalty programs, and the future of experiential rewards.\nROME, ITALY - JUNE 27: Qantas chef Neil Perry poses for a photo inside the Campo Di Fiori market in ... More the centre of Rome on June 27, 2022 in Rome, Italy. Neil is in Rome as part of the inaugural events for the first flight for Qantas from Perth to Rome, QF5 which arrived on June 26, 2022 at Rome's Fiumicino airport taking 15 hours and 34 minutes. Neil Perry oversees the design of the domestic and international in-flight menus for Qantas as well as the food served in the first and business class lounges. (Photo by James D. Morgan/Getty Images)\nEwen has been with The Points Guy for over a decade, turning a personal passion for points and travel into a career. Leading the editorial team, he covers everything from credit cards and loyalty programs to airlines, hotels, and cruises.\n\"The big thing driving the expansion of rewards cards is that consumers who have traditionally used cash or debit are realizing that they can earn valuable rewards without changing their spending habits,\" Ewen explains. \"Even a simple no-annual-fee credit card often offers 1% cashback or 1 point per dollar spent.\"\nAdditionally, Ewen points to the robust fraud protections credit cards offer. Unlike debit cards, which directly link to a user's bank account, credit cards provide layers of security and zero liability on fraudulent transactions. \"If your credit card is compromised, you're protected. If your debit card is compromised, your money could be gone. That peace of mind is a factor.\"\nAs competition among major credit card issuers intensifies, companies are looking beyond traditional points and cashback structures to differentiate themselves. Access to exclusive events—like presale concert tickets, sports and VIP experiences—has become a defining feature of premium credit cards.\n\"For example, Taylor Swift’s tour had a presale exclusively for Capital One cardholders. Citi had a similar arrangement for Beyoncé,\" Ewen shares. \"These kinds of partnerships give cardholders an edge in securing high-demand tickets.\"\nBeyond concerts, experiential perks are extending into sporting events, culinary experiences, and travel benefits. American Express, for example, offers cardholders lounge access at the U.S. Open and exclusive perks at festivals like Coachella and SXSW.\n\"These programs are looking to sell the dream. If you're going to spend money on travel, why not choose the card that gets you VIP treatment?\" Ewen asked.\nAirline rewards programs have been undergoing significant changes, particularly as premium cabin seats become more profitable for airlines to sell rather than upgrade. \"Fifteen years ago, elite status almost guaranteed an upgrade. Now, airlines are selling 80-85% of first-class seats, making free upgrades much harder to come by,\" Ewen explains.\nThis shift has led some travelers to reconsider airline co-branded credit cards in favor of more flexible reward programs like Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards.\n\"With transferable points, you can convert them to Delta, British Airways, or Air Canada as needed—rather than being locked into one airline’s ecosystem,” Ewen continued.\nWhile airlines still make billions from their co-branded card partnerships, they must balance keeping elite travelers engaged while also maximizing profits. \"The challenge is ensuring that loyal customers still feel rewarded. Otherwise, they may shift their spending to more flexible programs,\" Ewen said.\nLooking ahead, Ewen sees continued innovation in how credit cards drive engagement. \"We're seeing a movement toward blending travel, lifestyle, and financial flexibility into one seamless experience. Exclusive event access, dining perks, and travel protections are becoming just as important as the points themselves.”\nAs loyalty programs evolve, the ability to use points for experiences—whether that’s front-row seats to Coldplay or a luxury hotel upgrade—will be key. \"Consumers want more ways to use their rewards beyond flights and hotels. Credit card companies are listening, and we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible,\" he said.\nWith major players like American Express, Chase, Capital One, Citi, and Wells Fargo refining their strategies, the battle for consumer loyalty is heating up.\nConsumers expect their credit cards to deliver more than just rewards; they want access, security, and unforgettable experiences."

            "full_content": "A reunião realizada nesta terça-feira (11) entre o presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, com cerca de 100 CEOs das mais diversas empresas, não só mostrou a pressão em cima do líder máximo estadunidense, mas, também, como ele está tranquilo quanto ao futuro econômico do país.\nCEOs de empresas, como Walmart, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs e Wells Fargo, ouviram de Trump suas políticas econômicas, que incluem tarifas, visando corrigir desequilíbrios comerciais, trazer empregos de volta aos EUA e combater o tráfico de narcóticos ilegais.\nSegundo ele, “as tarifas vão gerar muito dinheiro para este país” e atrair empresas estrangeiras para construírem fábricas nos Estados Unidos.\nNo entanto, as políticas tarifárias, especialmente aquelas que afetam Canadá e México, geraram preocupações nos mercados financeiros, pois podem elevar os preços para as empresas, aumentar a inflação e prejudicar a confiança do consumidor.\nO presidente afirmou que, a curto prazo, as políticas podem causar algum “sofrimento“, mas trarão benefícios a longo prazo. No entanto, economistas do Goldman Sachs reduziram suas previsões de crescimento para 2025 e aumentaram as projeções de inflação devido ao impacto das tarifas.\nA Business Roundtable, que representa os principais líderes empresariais, defendeu a permanência dos cortes de impostos e a reforma regulatória, mas pediu que o governo remova rapidamente as tarifas para evitar impacto econômico negativo.\nAo mesmo tempo, o grupo enfatizou a importância de manter os benefícios do Acordo de Livre Comércio da América do Norte (USMCA, na sigla em inglês), assinado durante o primeiro mandato de Trump, com México e Canadá.\nLeandro Criscuolo é jornalista formado pela Faculdade Cásper Líbero.

Here are today’s research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nEasily identify stocks' risks and opportunities.\nDiscover stocks' market position with detailed  competitor analyses.\nMoffettNathanson upgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,100, up from $850. The firm believes the company’s ability to monetize its engagement remains underappreciated.\nWilliam Blair upgraded DocuSign (DOCU) to Outperform from Market Perform. The firm is bullish on the market opportunity for the company’s Intelligent Agreement Management platform and the ability of a new product cycle to reaccelerate growth back to double digits.\nDA Davidson upgraded Monday.com (MNDY) to Buy from Neutral with a $350 price target. The firm, which says it has “always viewed Monday.com as a great company whose shares fairly reflected its premium quality,” calls the recent pullback “an opportune time to take a second look at an attractive entry point.”\nBaird upgraded Accenture (ACN) to Outperform from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $390. The firm expects the company’s fiscal Q2 to beat estimates “mildly” and views its Managed Services demand to be strong, which is 50% of revenue.\nUBS upgraded Blackstone (BX) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $180. The firm believes the recent 27% selloff in the shares “provides a window to invest in a premier” alternative investment platform with structural and scale advantages at a reasonable valuation.\nH.C. Wainwright downgraded Sutro Biopharma (STRO) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $2, down from $12, after the company announced a strategic realignment focused on advancing its next-generation antibody-drug conjugate pipeline while deprioritizing luvelta due to financial constraints.\nWells Fargo downgraded TriplePoint Venture (TPVG) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $6.50, down from $7.50.

The firm cites the company’s increased likelihood of a base dividend cut in 2025 for the downgrade.\nEvercore ISI downgraded EastGroup Properties (EGP) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $185, up from $181. The firm says that while EastGroup’s shallow bay industrial portfolio remains well leased at 97% and demand still remains solid despite tariff concerns, the implied share upside is limited based on the stock’s $180 closing price on Friday.\nRedburn Atlantic initiated coverage of Reddit (RDDT) with a Sell rating and $75 price target. While high multiples are not unjustified for fast-growing internet platforms given the size of the online advertising market and the business model’s inherent operating leverage, Reddit’s “significant premium” to Pinterest (PINS) will be increasingly viewed as “far too lofty” as Reddit’s growth rates start to normalize, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nRBC Capital initiated coverage of Nextracker (NXT) with an Outperform rating and $55 price target. The firm believes Nextracker’s “unique” product design can reduce overall system cost and its “industry leading” software can be a “significant value add for customers.”\nJefferies initiated coverage of Blueprint Medicines (BPMC) with a Buy rating and $135 price target. The firm finds the stock “quite attractive,” especially on the recent pullback.\nRBC Capital initiated coverage of Array Technologies (ARRY) with a Sector Perform rating and $7 price target.

Emerson has a favorable position in markets with still positive underlying long-term fundamentals, coupled with a strong track record of operational execution that should drive outsized financial returns over time,” the firm tells investors in a research note.\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

            "full_content": "After the Flyers surrendered their fourth goal not even halfway through Thursday night's game, Travis Konecny snapped his stick in frustration.\nHe skated to the bench and tossed the two pieces aside. The scene summed up the night for the Flyers.\nIn their final game before Friday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline, the Flyers were dismantled by the Jets, 4-1, at the Wells Fargo Center. The NHL's top team absolutely took it to John Tortorella's club.\n\"Obviously I think there are maybe a lot of distractions off the ice,\" Sean Couturier said, referring to the deadline. \"But it's on us to do a better job coming to the rink and being focused, showing up.\"\nThe Flyers (27-28-8) have lost three of their last four games (1-2-1) and are off to an 0-2-0 start to their season-long seven-game homestand. They failed to rebound from a flat and uninspiring 6-3 loss Tuesday night to the Flames. Tortorella wanted to flush that one down the toilet. He stuck to his word; there was no film study for the head coach.\n\"I didn't watch one second of that game,\" Tortorella said Thursday at morning skate. \"It's the first time this year that I did not watch a game and that was it. ... I just want a fresh look.\"\nThe Flyers didn't give him a new look.\nFind the latest Philadelphia Flyers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Philadelphia.\r\n\n\"My thoughts about the game tonight are going to stay in the locker room,\" Tortorella said. \"What I say up here with you guys will do the team no good. We didn't play well.\"\nMatvei Michkov and Tyson Foerster committed first-period penalties that led to goals. In the second period, Winnipeg added two more by beating the Flyers up ice and scoring in transition.\n\"It wasn't good enough, especially for this time of year,\" Couturier said. \"I thought we were flat for most of the game, they seemed to want it more. They're a good team, they made us pay.\"\nWith 2:42 minutes left in the game, Michkov scored his 20th goal of the season.\nThe Flyers ended up splitting their two-game regular-season series with the Jets (43-16-4). They edged Winnipeg, 2-1, in a shootout five days ago at Canada Life Centre. Prior to this loss, they had won the previous four meetings with the Jets by a combined score of 11-2.\n• Samuel Ersson made 23 saves on 27 shots.\nThe Flyers didn't play well in front of him. Winnipeg took advantage of the Flyers' penalties and poor backtracking.\n\"That's what happens when you take penalties against good power plays,\" Travis Sanheim said. \"It puts us on our heels and we couldn't recover and turn the tide.\"\nAt morning skate, Tortorella called this a \"pretty important game\" for Ersson. The 25-year-old was coming off a pair of subpar starts, including a short one two days ago when he was pulled after giving up three goals on five shots. With a quarter left in the season, the Flyers want to see how Ersson handles the load.\n\"It's a huge 20 games for that position because we're still evaluating Sam,\" Tortorella said. \"So for him, it's a huge 20 games.\"\nErsson wasn't his best Thursday night, but he was far from the primary issue.\n\"It's frustrating, I know I have to be a lot better, especially this time of year,\" Ersson said. \"But at the same time, I know I can be a lot better, too. For me, I know I'll turn it around here. I just have to focus on the right things.\"\nJets backup Eric Comrie stopped 21 of the Flyers' 22 shots.\n• Scott Laughton and Rasmus Ristolainen, two of the Flyers' most notable trade chips, each played and were a minus-1.\n\"I'm not trying to get rid of a Risto or a Scott Laughton,\" general manager Danny Briere said in January, \"but it's our duty to listen and do the right thing for the organization.\"\nCan the deadline weigh on guys?\n\"I think it can, yeah, definitely,\" Couturier said. \"Especially in the situation we're in. It is what it is, it's the business side of things. It's on us to be ready and control what we can control.\"\n• Tortorella mentioned how he needed Konecny to essentially spark himself. With how well the Noah Cates and Couturier lines had been playing, the head coach didn't want to change things up to just benefit Konecny.\nThe Flyers' leading scorer entered with no goals and two assists in five games since the 4 Nations Face-Off.\nKonecny agreed that the onus was on him. He referenced Claude Giroux as a guy who would spark himself.\n\"It didn't matter if he was going or not, he found a way to be effective,\" Konecny said Thursday after morning skate. \"That's what I'm trying to do right now, just finding a way to be effective during the game and I think everything else will kind of take care of itself.\"\nThe line of Konecny, Laughton and Andrei Kuzmenko had an active first period but couldn't push one across. Tortorella then switched up some lines over the second and third periods, searching for a possible jolt. Nothing seemed to work.\nKonecny has one goal and eight assists in the last 16 games.\n• Garnet Hathaway missed a third straight game after taking a blindsided hit a week ago in Pittsburgh.\n• After Friday's trade deadline, the Flyers are back in action Saturday when they host the Kraken (12:30 p.m. ET/ABC)."

            "full_content": "Az amerikai bankfelügyelet (OCC) hétfőn jelentette be, hogy megszünteti a Wells Fargo ellen 2021-ben hozott határozatot, amely eredetileg 250 millió dolláros bírságot is tartalmazott. A büntetést a bank jelzáloghitelezési veszteségkezelési programjának hiányosságai, valamint egy 2018-as határozat követelményeinek be nem tartása miatt szabták ki.\nCharlie Scharf vezérigazgató közleménye szerint ez már az ötödik lezárt büntetőintézkedés 2025 eleje óta. A bank megfelelőségi problémái 2016-ban kerültek reflektorfénybe, amikor kiderült, hogy\nalkalmazottai ügyfelek tudta nélkül nyitottak számlákat.\nA megfelelőségi problémák megoldása kiemelt prioritást élvezett Scharf 2019-es vezérigazgatói kinevezése óta, ami 11 büntetőintézkedés lezárását eredményezte.

O crédito é todo da doutora Nicole Paulk, CEO e fundadora da Siren Labs, uma das muitas empresas da iniciativa privada trabalhando com terapias genéticas por aqui.\nNicole usou esta frase para começar uma ótima conversa sobre o novo papel dos vírus no futuro da humanidade. Até pouco tempo atrás, eles estavam relacionados necessariamente a doenças e à morte (o virus do Sarampo já matou 300 milhões de pessoas no mundo e o do resfriado, 100 milhões), mas isso vai mudar rapidamente agora – porque nos últimos 30 anos, as descobertas científicas sobre os virus serem excelentes “entregadores de material genético” tornaram possível a edição genética. Eu já vi bastante coisa sobre o tema aqui, desde o keynote de Jennifer Doudna em 2017, e as promessas sempre foram interessantíssimas. Mas, neste ano, entendi que a edição genética finalmente está se tornando viável em escala.\nNicole contou que já existem terapias genéticas aprovadas pelo FDA para tipos específicos de cegueira congênita, síndromes como a atrofia muscular espinhal, e para o Parkinson. Terapias que podem ser acessadas hoje (sim, a um custo muito alto). Mas mais importante do que as que já estão aprovadas foi ver o mapa feito pelo Wells Fargo de todas as iniciativas existentes em todas as suas fases (exploratórias, testes clínicos, em fase de aprovação e aprovadas pelo FDA). Veja com os seus olhos e me conte se você não está tão espantado quanto eu.\nE o espanto não para por aí: Ben Lamm, da Colossal Technologies, retornou ao SXSW no maior palco do festival pra contar o que sua empresa – que ele define como uma companhia de software biológico – ambiciona para o futuro.\nEles revelaram nesta semana o “wooly mouse” – um ratinho de laboratório que tem os pelos de um mamute. Ele é o primeiro passo na direção da desextinção do mamute (animal extinto há 4 mil anos). Depois do mamute, eles pretendem desextinguir o pássaro dodo e o Thylaceno ou Tigre da Tasmânia.Se isso já parece ambicioso o suficiente (a ponto da gente suspeitar se é realmente viável), as outras coisas que Ben vê acontecendo nos próximos 20 anos em função da pesquisa genética são ainda mais poderosas:\nAssistir estas duas palestras ontem e hoje tornou tangível para mim uma das previsões de Amy Webb: os humanos terão total domínio sobre a vida e a natureza.\nEstaríamos tomando para a humanidade o poder do divino?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Aqui no B9, a gente adora uma conversa.

            "full_content": "O Índice de Preços ao Consumidor (CPI) dos Estados Unidos registrou alta de 0,2% em fevereiro, tanto no índice geral quanto no núcleo (excluindo alimentos e energia), abaixo das expectativas do mercado. A desaceleração foi impulsionada pela queda nos preços da gasolina e moderação em serviços como aluguéis, mas analistas do Wells Fargo alertam que a inflação permanece persistente, com riscos de alta por tarifas e pressões em bens duráveis.\nSegundo os economistas Sarah House, Michael Pugliese e Nicole Servi, o relatório obtido pelo Dinheirama trouxe “um alívio moderado após o choque de janeiro”, mas a inflação segue estagnada desde o início de 2024. “A dinâmica inflacionária mostra progresso, mas os riscos de tarifas e pressões nos serviços exigem cautela”, destacam. A taxa anual desacelerou para 2,8%, enquanto o núcleo atingiu 3,1%, o menor em três anos e meio.\nA moderação nos preços de energia (-1% na gasolina) e alimentos compensou aumentos pontuais, como o salto de 10,4% nos ovos. Já os serviços registraram desaceleração, com transporte caindo 0,8% devido a quedas em passagens aéreas e seguros de veículos. “A tendência de queda em serviços continua, mas bens duráveis, como carros usados, ainda pressionam”, explicam os analistas.\nDescubra os melhores investimentos com uma das maiores casas de análise do Brasil (COM 30% DE DESCONTO SÓ NESTE LINK)\nO Fed enfrenta um cenário complexo: o núcleo do deflator de gastos com consumo (PCE, preferido do banco central) deve subir 0,35% em fevereiro, mantendo-se próximo a 3%, acima da meta de 2%. “A inflação persistente e as tarifas ameaçam reacender pressões, mas o mercado de trabalho mostra fragilidades”, avalia o Wells Fargo, projetando cortes graduais de juros ainda em 2024.\nApesar do alívio no curto prazo, os economistas alertam que a inflação subjacente permanece elevada. O núcleo do CPI, excluindo alimentos e energia, registrou alta anualizada de 3,6% nos últimos três meses, “ainda desconfortável” para o Fed. “Os dados reforçam a cautela do FOMC, que deve equilibrar riscos de tarifas e desaceleração econômica”, dizem House e equipe.\nO relatório também destacou a volatilidade em setores como saúde: após um salto em janeiro, os preços de medicamentos prescritos ficaram estáveis. Já os preços de veículos novos recuaram 0,1%, enquanto usados subiram 0,9%, abaixo da média de 1,1% dos últimos seis meses. “A moderação em bens é positiva, mas insuficiente para compensar pressões externas”, ressalta o Wells Fargo.\nCom a inflação ainda distante da meta, o Fed deve adotar uma abordagem gradual. “Esperamos cortes de juros apenas no final do ano, conforme o mercado de trabalho arrefece”, afirmam os economistas. Enquanto isso, investidores monitoram o PPI desta quinta-feira para novas pistas sobre a trajetória de preços.\nEm resumo, o Wells Fargo vê o CPI de fevereiro como um sinal de progresso, mas reforça que a trajetória da inflação permanece incerta. “O Fed precisa navegar entre ventos contrários: tarifas que pressionam custos e uma economia em desaceleração”, concluem os analistas, projetando um caminho estreito para a política monetária em 2024.\nJunho segue como o mês provável (80,7%) para a retomada dos cortes de juros pelo Federal Reserve (Fed, o banco central norte-americano), com expectativa de redução de 0,25 ponto porcentual em 55,3%, enquanto as apostas para flexibilização de 0,50 ponto porcentual eram de 24,1% após a divulgação do índice de preços ao consumidor (CPI, na sigla em inglês) dos Estados Unidos, que subiu aquém do esperado. \nApós o dado, no entanto, a expectativa de reduções nos juros em maio subiu ligeiramente, de 32,3% para 34,3%, segundo a ferramenta FedWatch do CME Group.\nFelipe Massa: De piloto da F1 a empresário de sucesso | PrimoCast 423\nEm pronunciamento, Lula fala sobre Pé-de-Meia e amplia Farmácia Popular\nLula admite que seu governo é uma bagunça; vídeo\nPrimoCast: Os homens estão ficando fracos?\nLula traça “pacote econômico” eleitoral e abre o cofre\nEditor-chefe do Dinheirama.

            "full_content": "PHILADELPHIA — The Oklahoma State wrestling team entered Friday evening with four semifinalists at the NCAA Championships, only one of whom was the higher seed.\nThat one — heavyweight Wyatt Hendrickson — joined two before him who pulled upsets in the semifinals, giving the Cowboys three finalists on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. \nWith 125-pound Troy Spratley and 174-pound Dean Hamiti Jr. upsetting opponents before him, Hendrickson closed the night with his typical flair, scoring first- and third-period takedowns of reigning national champion Greg Kerkvliet on the way to an 8-2 decision.\nWhile Kerkvliet can be difficult to score on, Hendrickson stayed focused on his game plan.\n“It’s part of the mentality I went into that match with,” he said. “Obviously, I wanted to be smart, be strategic. But if I see an opportunity to score more points, you guys know I’m gonna take that opportunities.\n“You can’t be in there wrestling scared. My mentality was, if I shoot, I’m gonna take him down.”\nThe Cowboys ended the day in third place with 91 points, trailing Penn State at 135.5 and Nebraska at 101.5, with Iowa in fourth at 73.5.\nIn addition to the three finalists, OSU will have three others in placement matches in Saturday’s first session. \nDustin Plott, who was defeated by Penn State’s Carter Starocci in the semifinals, will be in the consolation semis with a chance to finish as high as third. Caleb Fish at 157 and Cameron Amine at 165 will each be in the seventh-place match. \nDean Hamiti Jr. isn’t taking any calls at this time.\nThe third-seeded 174-pounder from Oklahoma State upset Penn State’s Levi Haines, the No. 2 seed who won a national title at 157 last year.\nAnd Hamiti responded with a subtle celebration his fans have been asking for.\nHe held his hand to his face with the thumb and pinky finger extended like a phone, then mimicked slamming it down.\n“It’s just a thing I did at one dual and everyone was like, ‘When are you gonna do the phone again?”” Hamiti said. “I thought that was the perfect place to do it.”\nHaines had lost just once this season, but Hamiti worked his quick ankle shots to  keep Haines off balance. Though he secured only one takedown, that coming less than 15 seconds into the match.\nFrom there, it was a battle of escapes and close calls, with Hamiti hanging on for the tight victory, securing his spot in Saturday’s championship match against a familiar foe, Missouri’s Keegan O’Toole.\nO’Toole gave Hamiti his only loss of the season, 7-4 in sudden-victory overtime two weeks ago in the Big 12 finals. Hamiti says keeping his defense working well like it did Friday will be key against O’Toole.\n“It’s been a key emphasis the past two weeks that I want to improve,” he said. “Just going out there and doing what I worked on.”\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nCameron Amine came to Oklahoma State as a three-time All-American. He will leave as a four-timer.\nAmine got a takedown and nearfall in sudden-victory over time for an 8-1 decision over Illinois’ Braeden Scoles in the blood round.\nAmine looked to be in line for a 1-0 win late in the third period. He had ridden Scoles for the entire second period, then escaped midway through the third. But with 26 seconds left, Amine was penalized for stalling, tying the score at 1. \nThat forced overtime and Amine finished it with 30 seconds to go.\nAmine was a three-time All-American at Michigan in 2021-23. He'll be in action in the consolation quarterfinals on Saturday morning where the No. 8 seed will take on fourth-seeded Terrell Barraclough of Utah Valley.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nAffectionately known as the blood rounds, the consolation round of the bracket that separates All-Americans also-rans is among the most intense events of the NCAA Championships.\nOSU went 1-1 in its first two opportunities in the blood rounds, with 157-pound Caleb Fish achieving All-America status for the first time in his career. Fish got a takedown for a 7-4 decision over  Michigan’s Chase Saldate. \nFish can’t finish lower than eighth and will be in action Saturday morning in the consolation quarterfinals.\nAt 141, OSU’s Tagen Jamison likewise found himself in sudden-victory overtime and looked to be working toward a takedown when Navy’s Josh Koderhandt sidestepped him and secured the winning takedown of his own in a 4-1 decision.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nDespite being a No. 7 seed and having lost in the Big 12 finals two weeks ago, Oklahoma State 125-pounder Troy Spratley maintained the focus needed to contend for an NCAA championship.\n“No, I always knew I was the guy,” Spratley said after his semifinal victory, a 6-4 decision over third-seeded Eddie Ventreseca of Virginia Tech in the tiebreaker overtime period. “I didn’t care about that. I mean, obviously, I cared that I lost in the finals, but I thought that was just a little bit more motivation. I came in here hungry.”\nNeither wrestler had a takedown during regulation, though Spratley had a reversal before giving up two escapes to tie the score at 2. Neither could land a shot in the first sudden-victory overtime.\nIn the first tiebreaker, Vetreseca escaped quickly, but Spratley almost immediately answered with his first takedown of the match. When Spratley escaped in the second tiebreaker, he led 6-3 and dodged Ventreseca’s attacks from there, drawing a stalling penalty along the way.\nSpratley will face fourth-seeded Vincent Robinson of North Carolina State in the championship round, set for 6 p.m. Saturday.\nRobinson defeated Spratley 7-3 when the teams met in January at Gallagher-Iba Arena.\n“It’s gonna be a fun one,” Spratley said. “Looking to get revenge.” \n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nThrough three sessions of the NCAA Championships, OSU sits in third place with 63 points, still within striking distance of second-place Nebraska at 65.5.\nAs expected, Penn State continues to pull away, posting 90.5 points through Friday’s quarterfinal round.\nThe semifinals are set to begin at 7 p.m. Friday, with the Cowboys claiming four spots in that round.\nOSU semifinalists are Troy Spratley at 125 pounds, Dean Hamiti Jr. at 174, Dustin Plott at 184 and Wyatt Hendrickson at heavyweight.\nStill alive in the consolations for the Cowboys are Tagen Jamison at 141, Caleb Fish at 157 and Cameron Amine at 165. Each of them will earn All-America status with a win in their elimination matches Friday night.\nAll seven wrestlers will be back in action Friday night.\nJamison was the last to add points to the OSU total, earning a 17-2 technical fall over South Dakota State’s Julian Tagg in an elimination match at the end of Friday’s early session. \n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nWith stoppages for his bloody mouth and his injured knee, Teague Travis’ shortened season ended Friday afternoon at the NCAA Championships. \nThe late-season addition to the lineup at 149 pounds, Travis fought his way through a difficult final match that also resulted in a swollen eye. \nTravis went 3-2 in the tournament with three major decisions, doing his most to help the Cowboys in a challenging and unique situation.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nOU’s DJ Parker moved one win away from securing a top-eight finish, and thus, All-America status in the 184-pound bracket.\nParker pinned Iowa’s Gabe Arnold in 48 seconds in an elimination match near the end of Friday’s early session.\nParker is the last surviving Sooner, after 141-pound Mosha Schwartz was pinned by Bucknell’s Dylan Chappell in an elimination match.\nIt was a wild showdown, with Schwartz taking a 7-0 lead in the first period with a takedown and nearfall, only to see Chappell come back with two second-period takedowns. \nMore action in the third led to Schwartz taking a 14-11 lead before Chappell secured the pin.\nOU ends the early session with 10.5 points, tied for 27th.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nIn a different reality, this would be a Bedlam match for the ages. \nFormer Oklahoma State wrestler AJ Ferrari, who won the 2021 national championship as a freshman at OSU, advanced to the 197-pound semifinals as the No. 3 seed for Cal State Bakersfield. \nHis opponent will be second-seeded Iowa wrestler Stephen Buchanan, who was an All-American at OU in 2024.\nFerrari suffered serious injuries in a car accident that ended his sophomore season at OSU in 2022, and the following summer, he was dismissed after being charged with sexual assault. The charges were later dropped. \nFerrari returned to wrestling for the 2024-25 season, classified as a redshirt sophomore, at Cal State Bakersfield. \nHe is undefeated after a 2-0 win over Pitt’s Mac Stout in Friday’s quarterfinals, his third win of the tournament. \n“The match didn’t go the way I wanted it,” Ferrari said. “All three of these matches, I don’t think any of these dudes are on my level technically, athletically or conditioning-wise. I should’ve pushed the pace more that match. But I’m a winner. I find a way to win.\n“I think you guys have seen my growth and the way I carry myself. I have that holy spirit. I’m not living in the flesh. I still have that 675-pound deadlift. I still have that personality. But I’m not vain, I’m not prideful. And that’s been a big testament to Cal State. Some of these smaller programs, they really help you grow as a person. Coach Luke Smith has done that.”\nBuchanan redshirted in 2023, then earned his third All-America honor last year after picking up the first two at Wyoming. He went 29-3 at OU, then transferred to Iowa in the offseason, where he has gone 24-1 this season.\nThe semifinal round is set to start at 7 p.m. Friday night at the Wells Fargo Center. \nThird verse, same as the first. OSU heavyweight Wyatt Hendrickson pinned his third opponent in as many matches, this time taking down seventh-seeded Isaac Trumble of North Carolina State at the 2:15 mark of the first period. \nThe win makes Hendrickson a three-time All-American. But now, it gets real for Hendrickson, the No. 2 seed in the bracket. \nIn Friday night’s semifinals, he’ll face Penn State’s third-seeded Greg Kerkvleit, the reigning champion who has only one loss this year — to top-seeded and two-time champ Gable Steveson, who is rolling through opponents on the other side of the bracket.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nFor the fourth straight year, OSU’s Dustin Plott will be an All-American. Plott defeated 12th-seeded Silas Allred of Nebraska 12-5 in the quarterfinals to assure that Plott won’t finish lower than sixth place. \nPlott had two escapes in the first period, two escapes in the second, then another takedown in the third to pull away for the win.\nThe fourth-seeded Plott will face No. 1 Carter Starocci of Penn State in Friday night’s semifinals.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nHeading to the last round of consolations in Friday’s early session, OU has two wrestlers still alive.\nIn addition to Mosha Schwartz at 141, OU has DJ Parker at 184. Parker advanced his name in the bracket with a 16-1 technical fall in the third period. Parker had a takedown and four-point nearfall in the first period, then matched it in the second. \nWith a two-point nearfall in the third, he ended the match. He’ll face Iowa’s Gabe Arnold in an elimination match later Friday afternoon.\nOU 174-pounder Gaven Sax suffered his second straight loss of the event, this one a 4-2 decision to Chattanooga’s Sergio Desiante in an elimination match.\nAt 149, OU’s Willie McDougald saw his tournament end with a 4-1 sudden-victory overtime defeat against Rider’s Sammy Alvarez.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nOSU has its second semifinalist of the day. The Cowboys’ 174-pounder, Dean Hamiti Jr., held on for a hard-fought 8-6 decision over 11th-seeded Patrick Kennedy of Iowa. \nKennedy tied the match at 5 with an escape early in the third, but Hamiti responded with another quick takedown. Kennedy escaped again, but Hamiti avoided his attacks over the final 63 seconds for the win.\nHamiti, the No. 3 seed, has secured All-America status for the third time in his career. He will face Penn State’s No. 2 Levi Haines in Friday night’s semifinals.\nCrossing paths with one of the country’s most dominant wrestlers, OSU 165-pounder Cameron Amine suffered a 5-0 loss to top-seeded Mitchell Messenbrink of Penn State. \nMessenbrink is now 25-0 on the season, but the decision against Amine was just his second that didn’t produce bonus points. \n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nNorthwestern’s No. 20 Trevor Chumbley continued his Cinderella run toward the national title with a 6-4 upset of OSU’s 12th-seeded Caleb Fish.\nChumbley scored a reversal to take a 3-2 lead early in the third, then added the winning takedown with 20 seconds remaining.\nFish, who upset the No. 5 seed on Thursday night, will be back in action in an elimination match on Friday night, needing one win to secure All-American status.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nTeague Travis’ unexpected postseason run continues.\nThe Cowboys’ 149-pounder, who only entered the lineup two weeks ago ahead of the Big 12 Championships, avoided elimination with a 12-2 major decision over Ty Whalen of Princeton, the No. 15 seed.\nTravis, seeded 33rd because he had only seven matches entering the week, has earned three major decisions to go with one loss, which came to the No. 1 seed. \n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nOU 141-pounder Mosha Schwartz was two minutes away from seeing his NCAA tournament end. But the No. 19 seed came to life in the third period of his match against Cornell’s Joshua Sanders for a 13-8 decision.\nFacing elimination, Schwartz trailed 6-3 after the second period,, but scored two takedowns and a four-point nearfall over the final 94 seconds of the match.\nAt 125 pounds, the Sooners suffered their first elimination of the day with Antonio Lorenzo suffering a 5-0 loss to Wisconsin’s Nicolar Rivera.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nOSU’s seventh-seeded Tagen Jamison moved forward in the consolation bracket at 141 with a pin of Stanford’s Jason Miranda in the third period.\nJamison had dominated the match, building a 13-3 lead before putting Miranda on his back to earn another bonus-point win for the Cowboys.\n — Scott Wright, Staff writer\nOSU’s seventh-seeded Troy Spratley pulled off one of the biggest upsets to this point in the NCAA Championships, defeating second-seeded Matt Ramos of Purdue, who entered the week with just one loss this season.\nIn the 5-2 decision, Spratley struck first with a takedown late in the first period.

            "full_content": "DES MOINES, IA - MARCH 18: Dylan Disu #1 and Dillon Mitchell #23 of the Texas Longhorns celebrate ... More after adding their team to the bracket following their 71-66 win against the Penn State Nittany Lions during the second round of the 2023 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament held at Wells Fargo Arena on March 18, 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo by Jamie Sabau/NCAA Photos via Getty Images)\nThe NCAA Tournament round of 64 officially tips off this Thursday. Professional and amateur bracketologists alike are making their picks and stipulating which underdogs could defy the odds and pull off stunning upsets. While three out of four of this year’s No. 1 seeds are expected to make the Final Four, history tells us that not all upsets are created equal. While No. 12 seeds love ruining dreams, and No. 14 seeds occasionally shake up the bracket, some matchups have been more predictable than others. Using historical data, I analyzed the likelihood of each seed beating every other seed.\nSince the NCAA expanded the men’s basketball tournament to 64 teams in 1985, there have been 39 seasons of March Madness, creating a rich dataset with over 2,500 individual matchups. This vast history includes countless Cinderella stories and enough results to reveal meaningful patterns in upsets and seeding trends. By analyzing this deep statistical pool, we can identify which seeds consistently overperform or underperform expectations. Below is a heatmap illustrating the historical winning percentages of each seed when facing another seed.\nThe heatmap shows the historical winning percentage of each seed against every other seed. The color ... More of the heatmap corresponds with the winning percentage of the seed on the horizontal axis against the seed on the vertical axis.\nThe bottom-left to top-right diagonal represents the winning percentage of teams against opponents of the exact same seed. These matchups occur only in the First Four, Final Four, or National Championship games. Notably, No. 6-9 and No. 15 seeds have never faced a team of the same seed in tournament history.\n The top-left to bottom-right diagonal displays winning percentages in Round of 64 matchups, which provide the most data. As expected, higher-seeded teams generally have a better winning percentage, but certain matchups offer more parity than others. The No. 8 versus No. 9 matchup is historically the most balanced, while the No. 1 versus No. 16 matchup is the most lopsided. Only two No. 16 seeds have ever pulled off the upset: UMBC over Virginia in 2018 and Fairleigh Dickinson over Purdue in 2023.\nFairleigh Dickinson guard Joe Munden Jr. (1) drives on Purdue guard Brandon Newman (5) in the second ... More half of a first-round college basketball game in the NCAA Tournament Friday, March 17, 2023, in Columbus, Ohio. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\nDespite a difference of only one slot in seeding, No.15 seed dramatically outperform No. 16 seeds in the tournament and are over five times more likely to win their first-round game. Since 2021, three different No. 15 seeds have defeated a No. 2 seed including Princeton beating Arizona in 2023, Saint Peter’s beating Kentucky in 2022, and Oral Roberts beating Ohio state in 2021. Even more impressively, No. 15 seeds don’t just stop at one upset. After advancing past the Round of 64, they have posted a surprising 4-7 record in the second round, proving that when a No. 15 gets hot, they can make a real run.\nPHILADELPHIA, PA - MARCH 24:  Chase Fieler #20 and Brett Comer #0 of the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles ... More celebrate in the second half while taking on the San Diego State Aztecs during the third round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at Wells Fargo Center on March 24, 2013 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images)\nThe No. 5 versus No. 12 matchup has become synonymous with bracket chaos, and for good reason. Historically, No. 12 seeds win 33% of their matchups against No. 5 seeds—meaning that, on average, at least one No. 12 seed advances each year. To put this in perspective, a No. 12 seed has nearly the same upset potential as a No. 10 seed against a No. 7 seed (39%), despite facing a much higher-ranked opponent. The 5/12 upset trend is a staple of March Madness bracket strategy, making No. 12 seeds prime candidates for early-round surprises.\nIf you’re looking for a deep Cinderella run, look no further than the No. 11 seed. Since 2011, a staggering fifteen No. 11 seeds have reached the Sweet 16, making them one of the most consistent double-digit seeds to advance beyond the first weekend. Even more remarkably, six No. 11 seeds have made it to the Final Four. This elite group of Cinderella teams includes 2024 NC State, 2021 UCLA, 2018 Loyola-Chicago, 2011 VCU, 2006 George Mason, and 1986 LSU. None of these teams made it to the championship game. The No. 11 seed is an undefeated 6-0 against No. 4, No. 7, and No. 9 seeds and am impressive 4-6 against No. 1 seeds.\nWhile No. 8 and No. 9 seeds are evenly matched in the first round, their real danger lies in the second round. If an 8/9 winner can take down a No. 1 seed, their path to the Elite Eight becomes significantly easier. Historically, No. 8 and No. 9 seeds hold a 23-29 record against teams seeded No. 2-7. In particular, they have posted winning records against No. 4 and No. 5 seeds in the Sweet 16, proving that when they survive the early rounds, they can go much further than expected.\nDALLAS, TEXAS - MARCH 31: DJ Burns Jr. #30 of the North Carolina State Wolfpack cuts a piece of the ... More net after defeating the Duke Blue Devils during the Elite Eight round of the 2024 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament held at American Airlines Center on March 31, 2024 in Dallas, Texas. (Photo by Andy Hancock/NCAA Photos/NCAA Photos via Getty Images)\nA No. 15 seed upset is always fun to watch but nearly impossible to predict. For a more reliable first-round upset, the 5/12 matchup is your best bet. If you are hunting for deep Cinderella runs, No. 11 seeds have the strongest track record. If you want a high-risk, high-reward bracket, keep an eye on No. 8 and No. 9 seeds poised to take down a No. 1 seed, especially with injuries plaguing both Duke and Houston. History shows that once an 8 or 9 seed knocks off a top team, their run may be far from over."

            "full_content": "Senior Contributor. \nOnline store owner making plans for product shipping. \nWomen-owned businesses in the U.S. continue to thrive. According to the National Women’s Business Council (NWBC) Annual Report, there are 14.5 million women-owned businesses that account for nearly 40% of all businesses in the U.S. In 2024, they had an estimated $508.5 billion in annual payroll, as reported by Census Bureau (Nov. 2024).\nThis week, in its annual analysis of over 53,000 companies, the Biz2Credit Women-Owned Business Study found that the funding percentage (36%) for women-owned businesses that applied for financing in 2024 increased from 35% in 2023. In comparison, the funding rate for male-owned businesses in 2024 was just 29%.\nAdditionally, the average funding amounts women received jumped by 25% from 2023 to 2024. The average funding amount for women-owned businesses was $53,678 in 2023. A year later, in 2024, the average amount was $67,035.\nWomen-owned firms employ 12.2 million workers and generate $2.7 trillion in revenue, according to the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Business Report, which also found that the number of women-owned businesses between 2019 and 2023 increased at nearly double the rate of those owned by men. In fact, the number of female-owned firms increased 11.5% from 2019 to 2024.\nData suggests that women-owned businesses emerged stronger from the COVID pandemic than they did from the 2008 financial crisis. Female-run companies owned by African Americans and Latinas performed notably well between 2019 and 2023. Wells Fargo reported that African American women-owned businesses saw average revenues increase 32.7% and Latina-owned firms experienced a 17.1% rise.\nAccess to capital has indeed expanded in recent years. For instance, according to the Small Business Administration (SBA)’s FY24 Capital Impact Report released last October, the SBA administered 15,500 loans for $5.6 billion to majority women-owned businesses, doubling in women-owned business participation relative to FY20.\nFurther analysis showed that the average annual revenue of women-owned firms in 2024 increased 15% to nearly $520,000, although expenses rose as well.\nThe funding rate and average loan amount for women-owned businesses rose in 2024, which is good news. The percentage of funding applications from women was 36%, compared to 29% for men last year. Women-owned businesses have also shortened the gap in average funding size to just 20% less than men-owned businesses, a significant improvement compared to last year’s difference of 40%.”\nAll is not rosy, however. Women business owners, along with their male counterparts, saw expenses rise significantly largely because of inflation in 2024. SMBs are hoping that costs will come down, although it has not happened yet.\nThe Biz2Credit Women-Owned Business Study examined financial indicators including annual revenue, operating expenses, earnings, age of business, credit scores, funding rates, and funding amounts of companies that applied for credit on Biz2Credit’s online lending platform in 2024. The data was then tabulated to examine women-owned and men-owned businesses based on annual revenue, operating expenses, age of business, personal credit score, funding rate, and average loan size. The study looked at 20 different industries, as well as geography.\nIn 2024, women-owned small and medium sized businesses saw excellent growth in capital accessibility compared to their male counterparts. However, they also felt the impact of rising expenses on their earnings. High costs are still a concern this year for small business owners.\nIt is unclear at this time how the new policies of the Trump administration will impact business owners. He seems committed to tariffs, which will drive up costs for some types of small businesses, but less so for others. For example, food service businesses that use avocados will see cost increases related to the tariffs on Mexico. Smaller import companies that sell foreign-made goods like wine, cheese, and electronics made in other countries will pay more for these items. Manufacturing companies that use foreign-made inputs will see a rise in costs that will be passed along to consumers in the form of rising prices.\nHowever, small businesses could respond by touting their American made-products and inputs. Additionally, many small businesses, particularly women-owned businesses, are service businesses that will likely not be impacted greatly by tariffs.\nTariffs: 4 Things Small Businesses Can Do Now To Survive\nRoger Williams (R-TX), chair of the House Committee on Small Business, has expressed optimism that Trump administration policies will help small business owners.\n“This Committee looks forward to working alongside President Trump to not only cut burdensome regulations across the board, but to address the tax code and ensure that small businesses are able to compete, spur growth, and achieve the American Dream,” he said.\nWASHINGTON, DC —President Donald Trump listens while meeting with women small business owners in ... More 2017 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by  Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images)\nWhat will be of critical importance is the continuing flow of capital to small businesses, which are the driver of job-creation in the private sector and an important part of the economy overall.\nRelated: What The Interest Rate Drop Means For Small Businesses\nWomen-owned businesses received a larger percentage of loan approvals and increased loan amounts in 2024. These are good signs for female business owners. The funding gap for women-owned businesses is closing, and with his smaller government, pro-business outlook, President Trump is expected to keep pushing for lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve and to keep working to ensure the flow of capital to small business owners continues in order to drive growth of the domestic economy."

Gunna have to batten down the hatches tomorrow in the same way that you probably do when expecting severe weather-\nhttps://apnews.com/article/cyclone-alfred-australia-brisbane-gold-coast-f40a46f400f42d7d94dc5a91cb11c11a\nWondering if we will lose power and the internet too. Time to fill up the thermosflasks.\n@Rev Kev … depending on the eyes land fall, north of Brisbane bad, eye center not so bad, and just even 20 klm south – phew – all the nasty is on the clockwise 8/7/6 position. \nSo now its down to amount of rain in hrs flowing to the sea, whilst huge storm surge w/high tide timed with cyclone landing and 6/7 meter waves backs rivers up. The really big question is how wind gust of up to 150 klm w/ sustained 55/75 klm effect buildings not built for it. Brisbane has never had a cyclone direct hit IMO. The floods of 74/2011/2022 were completely different.\n74 was a prolonged 7 day soak without the Wivenhoe dam. 2011 was due to crazy rain fall in N. Toowoomba w/ already soaked soil racing to Wivenhoe, which necessitated large volume release. Had they released earlier to accommodate inflows it could have been all avoided. 2022 [east coast low] is similar in the sense of 300+mm of rainfall in a short 48+ hr time frame overwhelming catchments via outflows.\nSo, we have the latter above with/multiplied by storm surge plus high tide and 6+ meter waves, with sustained 55/75 klm hr winds with gusts up to 150 klm hr. Not to mention this is a slow moving cyclone[7 klm hr], good in the sense of time to prepare, bad in the sense of how much time it has to effect everything pre and post land fall. There are about 20K homes that are classically inundated and another 40K effected just from flooding around historical norms of 3.3[2013] to 4.6[2011] meter heights. \nThe next 24 hrs is a big question mark, maybe Cat3, where and when with high tide[????], yet the high winds will be the factor missing in all the previous examples. At least this time I am not a block away from the Brisbane River in Jindalee[2011] and on the side of a hill in Chapel Hill, albeit just a block up from Cubberla Creek reserve. All stocked up with food and grog [wheat beer/Jap whiskey] and dog food and roads will be cut off for a few days in spots. Everyone I know is doing the same with aplomb and as its said in Queensland – if we have beer – we can rebuild~~~\nCyclone Alfred (Thursday) – Gales, rain, huge seas – we have the latest forecast to Monday – WeatherWatchTV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr3kRCDzIRY\nThanks for all that info, skip. Would have replied earlier but just got back in. I guess that we are as ready as will be but unless you have lived through similar, you really don’t know what to expect. The daughter is off work the past two days as they are afraid flooding will cut people off from getting home and this seems to be happening right across the board. Have noticed fewer cars on the roads as well so just waiting for the other shoe to drop right now.\nAll good and no dramas mate … one thing to consider depending on the age of your home is windows. The problem is if older are not built for sideways rain and will find its way into your home. They would have to be taped at the bottoms from the outside and as always gutters clean.\nNext is the orientation of your home to the wind or anything that might be blow at it, hence you might want to tape windows from the inside to stop shattering. Not to mention structural aspects which the wind might attack with up lift. If memory serves you are out past the Wool Shed and The Gap way. As such the up lift in terrain means more rain, some hinterland from Litton to Brisbane has projections of 750 mm in 48 hrs. \nA side my youngest lose head prop diesel mech son is dirty as tomorrow is his 21st B-day and all the fun over the weekend its off. Going to shack up with his GF in Caloundra – wink/wink. \nAt the end of the day this cyclone is driving the modelers mad, doing very strange things, even after cross referencing 4/5 models its all going to come down to the hour on the day.\nWinds is going to be the biggest ???? mark and then post land fall and 48 hrs how it unfolds as it moves inland and effects catchments/dams. Thing is Gold Coast is going to cop it one way or another, surge/waves, wind, its all open. Then its hinterlands.\nAnywho … I have my stuff sorted here, afterwards I have my chainsaw, tools and knowledge on lend for my neighbors if needed.\nPS love this country … everyone out and about with dogs and kids at the reserve down the road getting it in before the cyclone hits, no dramas at the shops, etc. BTW looking forward to sharing out experiences with the NC readership as it all happens [live in stereo] as long as the IT lives …\n>Men with higher-quality sperm live longer, study finds – The Guardian\nNow that’s is one of the most useless headlines I’ve ever read, but hey, it’s the Guardian. How about, men with higher-quality healthcare, a good diet, and lower stress levels live longer? Nah, go for the lurid.\nIt is the Guardian. Of course its health coverage would be trash (as you clearly know). Which is why, as it being in an area I could say something (maybe) interesting about, I went looking for what the real experts I used to work with said. Yep, the Guardian is reporting the simplistic take on it all. Those Islingtonistas who definitely didn’t get their jobs via nepotism are perfectly capable of interpreting this for us ;-)\nKinda wonder if the Daily Mail might (as Yves has mentioned herself in the past) have a better take on this…..But I don’t like searching for DM articles……I’d rather search for pron.\nIt is hard to find good original reporting, and you have to respect the Guardian for pivoting to the one subject their entire staff is intimately familiar with.\nRe sperm quality/count. I wonder if they looked at/are looking at auto-immune conditions (and the weird spikes seen increasingly frequently since March 2020). A quick search for the guy who wrote the original NHS guidelines for treatment of non-specific urethritis gave this as a link. The first author is him. I used to work indirectly with him and (slightly discomfited him when I ended up being seen by him for NSU – which, take my word for it, wasn’t sexually transmitted. He ended up concluding “this is auto-immune; take low dose amitriptylline to deal with discomfort”, which worked and simultaneously cured my lifelong insomnia but that’s another story.)\nThe more recent work seems to bear out things he expressed suspicions about way back then – namely the autoimmune stuff. The link with eye stuff is especially interesting since I was diagnosed with chronice blepharitis in Sydney years ago and learning that my body is probably killing my sperm gave me a weird sense of satisfaction (having no desire to ever procreate). \nPlus, given the mentions made of mono infection, both for NSU and long COVID and I know I got mono shortly before my immune function really started concerted attacks on my body, it kinda makes me wonder if research on sperm may need more follow-up.\nIt seems that Zinc Sulfate is good for sperm quality. So is it good for lifespan as well? It seems like it.\nDiscovery of Human Zinc Deficiency: Its Impact on Human Health and Disease\n Interestingly, only the zinc-supplemented group showed increased longevity (74). The risk of mortality was reduced by 27% in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study Group studies in subjects 55–81 y of age who received only therapeutic zinc daily. \nSo could Zinc Sulfate help with COVID outcomes and our current decline in lifespan? I doubt we will ever see a serious study on this.\nAlso, you might want to see this:\nUnderstanding the Link Between Blepharitis and Zinc Deficiency\nhttps://eyesurgeryguide.org/understanding-the-link-between-blepharitis-and-zinc-deficiency/\nThanks. I discontinued my Vitamin C supplements in favour of ones that also incorporate Zinc a while back. However, I have since been warned to ensure I keep other supplements boosted that include things like copper since the two electrolytes work in tandem.\nThe blepharitis is, thankfully, rarely a problem for me these days. Provided I wash my eyes using a dedicated flannel daily and use Blephagel (thankfully on prescription these days since OTC cost is disgusting here in UK) then my eyes are fine. However, my old rhinitis symptoms are back with a vengeance since 2020. They were sorted in the early 2000s when my turbinates were lasered as part of a septoplasty – I was warned at the the time that the procedure only had a 50% success rate (hence why they only ever did it under the NHS if they were doing something else to your nose anyway) but thankfully it did work for me and I was freed from rhinitis meds. \nAs part of my long COVID it feels like anything that used to get inflamed is now getting inflamed again…..along with a bunch of other body parts. That’s life!\nAnd you need to keep your copper intake up. The best way is a daily 100-gram bar, 70%-85% dark chocolate which contains 1,770 micrograms of copper, around our daily requirements.\nI have zinc supplements to balance out my chocolate intake.\n>Is Everyone the Same Person? Nautilus\nThe next possibility is that the self simply doesn’t exist. That is, we may feel like we remain the same person over time—perhaps for evolutionary reasons—but we actually don’t. This is the no self view.\nI think this is the view of John Rogers Searle and other modern philosophers, what Rick Roderick called the “deflationary view” of the self (he died way too young).\nIf we are all fundamentally the same person, the only rational thing would be to care about the experiences of every conscious being as though they are your own, because that is what they actually will be.\nToo bad we are not merely “rational beings.”\nThere are hard wired (genetic) traits. Otherwise the self is a construct. We all, never the less, live in separate bodies. Although the entire biome could be considered a unified organism there is competition for resources and it is the individual that drives evolution.\nWe are ‘hardwired’ to be aware of ‘self, not-self’ as we wouldn’t survive long if we weren’t, but we are, indeed, only one being–as is the entirety of creation. I had a taste of this during a meditation retreat when, walking down a country lane, I suddenly became everything. I was the cow, delighting in eating grass while nursing her calf, the calf enjoying her milk, the bugs, worms, etc. in the soil, the joy of the grass growing and so on until all became burning ecstatic energy. The realization that all this wonder was so ephemeral was sad beyond measure. I cried for weeks. It was hard to drive,  as I was simultaneously driving all the cars! So…not very functional.\nHow many people have come back to a past decision and wondered “What was I thinking???”\nWhich says to me that we don’t remain the same person day in and day out. \nPerhaps who we are at any moment in time depends on how the people around us are acting,  what our financial situation is, what the government is doing to us, our age etc etc\n>Some DOGE Staffers Are Drawing Six-Figure Government Salaries Wired\nWow a whole “six figures!?” Has anyone at Wired lived in the DC area? About 16 years ago I rented a 1 bedroom apt. in Reston, VA for around ~$2.2k a month, can only imagine what a family needs to survive around DC.\nThe max possible. In the same range as people with a ten-year history. And no prohibition on other earnings.\nSo consult with those who stand to benefit from privatized while also being paid to facilitate looting and crippling the agencies to be privatized. Usinf any spare time to lay groundwork for blaming the government stealing taxpayer money when the newly privatized agencies have no value -despite the higher cost and total lack of oversight and accountability.\nQuite different than the volunteer, doing it for free claims even though they could be making “millions.” Claims made every single day by Elon Musk, the world’s most transparent crusader (according to him.)\nThe average annual pay across the entire federal workforce is $106,382, according to OPM, reflecting the skew toward white-collar jobs held by highly educated people. Half of all federal workers make between $50,000 and $109,999 a year. Relatively few (3%) make $200,000 or more, while 8% make less than $50,000., What the data says about federal workers, Pew Research. Lot’s of interesting info here.\nMedian would be a better measure.\n>Democrat Al Green removed from House after interrupting, heckling Trump The Hill\nRep. Al Green (D-Texas) was removed from the House chamber where President Trump was giving his address to a joint session of Congress after the congressman heckled the president early in his speech. \nI wonder if Al Green and Thomas Massie could form some coherent opposition on key issues like unconditional support for Israel and the never ending wars, could be that there are 2 Congressman with a backbone…though I know next to nothing about Rep. Green.\nI grew up watching the Watergate hearings as a young person.  I saw clips from hearings like the Church Committee.  I saw the Dems as the minority party, not so much in numbers but in momentum, doing the best they could with the Reagan Revolution.  Although I may not have agreed with all that was being said, the Democratic members were professional and had very important comments and arguments to make.  Ervin, Church, Moynihan, O’Neill, E Kennedy, among many others.  Who can ever forget Barbara Jordan during the Watergate hearings?  Those words will be remembered for all time.  Compare and contrast that to the Bingo/Auction placards last night……all the pink dresses being worn by the “feminist” women who had just 2 days ago refused to stop handing over young women’s scholarships to men…..Seriously?……..compare Barbara Jordan, a Black Texan, to the Black Texans Al Green and Jasmine Crockett, last night.  One ranting like a 3 year old……the other throwing one F bomb after another.  Unlike my parents who were happy to let me watch the goings on as a kid – I have to turn it off for my own.  The rants are either laced with profanity or they are so unhinged to the point that I just do not want them watching it, I do not want them thinking this is normal adult behavior.  \nSorry, I have known about the illness in the Democratic Party for some time.  The events of last night were just heart-breaking.  I just do not know what else to say.  And the really sad thing is I do not see any kind of solution on the horizon.  It just seems to be getting worse by the day.  This is profoundly tragic for the country.  We need some kind of organized opposition – not Romper Room.   I saw clips of Symone Sanders on MSNBC last night showing her reaction.  She is obviously in the same camp as I.  When you have lost Symone, guys, maybe you have a huge problem.\nIt had the look of a silent slave auction, with Donkey Show slaves doing the bidding.\n‘What am I offered for this 2 term Congressman who has accomplished nothing other than being a co-sponsor in renaming post offices and other Federal buildings?’\nOr a grotesque cameo by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) in the movie Get Out.\nThis behavior has set an unfortunate example at the local levels where towns and school boards are thinking of closing down public comments all together in meetings because they’ve too often turned into shouting matches from the floor.  It did not used to be this way.  People would raise their hand and wait to be called on to speak, and then the next person, etc.  Occasionally someone would get a little too heated and be asked to leave.\nNow it seems like shouting down the school board or town council has become a sport for some, at least in my blue uni town.\nNot just your town.  The rona had municipalities using zoom to hold meetings instead of going to city hall in person.  That made it very easy for cowardly people with racist Tourettes to chime in.  We had a rash of callers disrupting meetings who would have never dared to do so if they had to go in person.  But it sounds like many are taking it to the extreme in person too.\nIndeed.  One is reminded of Mark Twain’s writing about people hiding behind a mask.  (See ‘Puddin’ Head Wilson.’)\nPity the EU elites have never read Twain, or  if they did read Twain, they never understood his point. / ;)\nSpeaking of Watergate brings the long term decline in standards into sharp focus. Something like Watergate is just business as usual now and no-one would bother to investigate or prosecute. How are the mighty fallen and few worship the meek Galilean now, it is Mammon they all worship openly now.\nI used to think that Nixon was the worst and most dishonest President in history.\nThen I started to read about some of what he did that riled up the security establishment, like China. And now I think he was set up, given the spook history of the gallant whistleblowers.\nThe US state apparatus has a very murky history, and takes no prisoners. One way or another.\nHad the entire left side stood up in solidarity with Green I would have been impressed.\n>How Western Media Has Manufactured Consent For Atrocities, From Iraq To Gaza DAWN\n As Israel commits atrocities in Gaza with U.S. weapons and tax dollars, it is time for Western journalists to rectify the mistakes of the past and report the truth.\nI wish, unfortunately, as borne out in Ytube and other Google searches, the ends will be the same (manufacturing consent). Only now, the means/methods will become more refined, obscured, and effective, not to mention infiltration of alt-media. As Ellul points out both in his books on Propaganda and Technology, mass society needs the media to preform this function.\nGlenn Greewald guest host Lee Fang about the Oscar winning documentary.  ~14+ minutes.\nOscar-Winning Film SENSORED in the U.S.?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTK-7DuSv4I\n” ‘She did it at least three times’: Kristi Noem slammed over ‘childish’ insult to Canada”\n This is a 54 year-old woman doing this. One who as Secretary of Homeland Security expects to be taken seriously by the country. Normally if you had a woman there her age with grandchildren doing that sort of mickey-mouse stuff, that she would smack them upside the head and tell them to knock it off and to grow up. But in a Trump Cabinet she will probably get a high five-\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem\nWe live in a clownogenic environment!\nDid you catch the GOP rep who ripped a sign out of the hands of a Dem?\nThat’s likely civil battery … the Donkeys can boast that they at least did not commit any intentional torts last night.\nWhole thing was a clown show. Trump lying about just about everything, stupid democrats protesting with silly signs, like they were at an auction, and the pink suits.\nOh the power of their protest! Protesting musk pretty hilarious since Obama basically gave musk all sorts of taxpayer money on the sly. From solar panel rebates to space X. Biden loved himself some Starlink for Ukraine. They did get themselves all in a twist over being mean to Zelinsky. Get out the fainting couch! I think they must have forgotten the pink hats!\nIf he did that to me he would be picking himself off the ground.\nWe are being treated to “government” as performance from The Don to The Kristi to Al Green and the Silent Auction. Who needs Tik Tok when we have the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber?\nI eschew all social media except that reproduced elsewhere but I suspect cat and dog videos and influencers may be superior as performance.\nThere was an hilarious Washington Babylon post on Matt Gaetz yesterday that mentioned her a couple times.

Funny that.\nOur new Sarah Palin. / ;)\nSo we’re broke, but we have money for a Golden Dome and a rocket ship to Mars.  I wonder in whose pocket all that Dome and Mars money will go.\nI guess I hadn’t really been paying attention not to know that Musk is 53.  Unless he’s going to Mars after he passes 60, he’d better hurry up.  I regret that I have but one monthly Social Security check to give so that we can build Elon’s spaceship before he’s too old to go.  (Did Elon promise to take Trump’s kids and grandkids with him?)\nThe money does not come out of pockets but with official foolishness the value of it declines.\nYou’re broke, so you only have money for a promise of a Golden Dome and a rocket ship to Mars. Making them work would be prohibitively expensive.\n‘Defense for Children\n@DCIPalestine\n14-year-old Muin is the youngest Palestinian child on record to be issued an administrative detention order. Israeli forces are holding him without charge or trial on “secret evidence” not disclosed to him or his lawyer.’\nI notice in that image that he has his hands in his pockets but his thumbs are sticking out and I wondered if this was learned behaviour. A long time ago I met this Irish guy that was living there during The Troubles and he was talking about the constant British patrols. He said that people there learned to, when they had their hands in their pocket, have their thumbs sticking out. That way the British soldiers would not scrutinize them so bad as thumbs inside a pocket might indicate that it is wrapped around a gun while thumbs sticking out probably indicated they were safe.\nRe. What can Democrats learn from the Brits?\nMoney quote at end:  \n«You need politicians who can take a baseball bat to the idea that they are culturally and intellectually on a different planet to their voters. There’s Starmer. By 2024 he can say, I’ve killed Corbyn, I’ve killed Corbynism. I don’t stand for that stuff. Whoever ends up representing Democrats in 2028, there’s a compelling argument that their interests would be served by having some evidence of antagonism with the hard left.»\nI tend to harbor some hard left and middle ground philosphies, after a few scores of years on this browning earth. I’m thinking there is a ‘right path’ threading between Left and Right. One of the best books I read back in college (I know, I know…)  was Robert Heilbroner’s,  ” Between Capitalism and Socialism” .\nIt really sorted through and made compelling cases for the virtues of markets, and the obvious wisdom of well-managed and controlled utility functions.\n“We” can’t seem to agree on where the sun rises and the color of cloudless sky at mid-day any more.\nAnyway, great read, although it  sadly seems in this day and age it arguably is a waste of time! \nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4250997-between-capitalism-and-socialism\n\nHmm. I’d argue “Whatever Starmer does, do the EXACT OPPOSITE”. Nobody thought Corbyn was culturally/intellectually on a different planet to voters. They disliked him because he was demonstrably media-unsavvy, hung around with people who (rightly or wrongly) were personae non grata and simply was not the leader we needed for Corbynism. \nStarmer is haemorraging support round here. And in today’s Guardian we read that his chancellor is anti-welfare. I had to check I wasn’t subject to Mandela Effect on this and rechecked my tablet. I saw the article before it disappeared, and has now been relegated to a sub-entry in the “Live Feed” on the Guardian which I couldn’t work out how to link to. Hmmm. \nI just see people who without a major boost to public spending are deserting Labour for Reform here in “potential Reform UK land”. The Democrats should look to people who understand a balance sheet rather than the people in charge of the Brits. Watch Nottinghamshire in the May local elections – some major upheavals are summarised in the wiki and we’ll be interested to see what happens in a bunch of seats where Labour former councillors have “moved upstairs to Downing Street adjacent positions”.\nOr begin to show antagonism toward perpetual war…..\nDems are no different than RINOs lusting for war that profits the MIC.\n“Standing with Ukraine” is not different than Hitler lusting for the Caucasus oil…..\nOr, Hitler lusting for Ukraine and its mineral resources, oh, and standing with Ukraine, too.\nThe more things change…\nOr Blackrock lusting for that black soil.\nI think the Democrats have learned these lessons already. Conor spells it out in his essay today – they’re appealing to the “good” billionaires while blaming their failures on all that “leftist” stuff that turn people off. But then they had already learned these lessons with Carter, with Clinton, with Obama, and with Biden. This ain’t new. It’s cyclical.\n I can’t think of a more appropriate model for future Democrats than Starmer. I wonder which party will be the first to finally die?\nPutin Agrees to Help Trump Broker Nuclear Talks With Iran Bloomberg\nGuess Putin missed an opportunity to also offer to help Trump negotiate with Saudi Arabia over its vast natural resources of snow and ice.\nThere might actually be something with this idea. Both Russia and Iran have had treaties and agreements reneged on by the US so neither of them will trust Trump and so set up unrealistic expectations. The Iranians may agree to hold enrichment at 60% and the Russians will do all the inspecting and monitoring as nobody trusts the IAEA anymore. They are a busted flush. If the US learns to bite the bullet and trust the Russians here, they may have a working deal. Trump can say that he has made sure that Iran won’t develop nukes – which they were never going to do. The Iranians will get sanctions relief which will help their economy. And the Russians? Apart from all their economic agreements, the Russians will probably sell the Iranians highly sophisticated radars and anti-air missiles so that Israel does not come along and try to screw the whole thing up by making them secure from attack.\nAgree. Huge benefits for the Russians as it demonstrates benefits to US to deal and work with them. They might have to bite lips if Trump obsesses over their nuclear (weapons) program which may not even exist…like ice and snow in SA.\nWho is brokering nuke talks with Israel?\nThey only broker with themselves, just like they only investigate themselves, and police themselves and judge themselves. \nTis one of those mysteries why no one is willing to stop them.\nThe problem here is that we are dealing with “True Believers” of a Religious Fanatic stripe.\nThe only effective way to deal with such ‘True Believers’ is to eradicate them. That would require a possibly nuclear exchange. So, not being desirous of destroying the Middle East for a generation, everyone other than the Chosen State is hanging back and hoping for less destructive methods to provide relief.\nIn other words, the Middle East is being held hostage by a clinically insane ruling elite.\nOne side effect of any “intervention” in this issue will be huge price spikes in the price of petrochemicals. The “fall out,” (pun intended,) will be global in nature. The Samson Option is alive and well.\nThere might actually be something with this idea. Buying time.

He said ‘I think we’re going to get it one way or the other. We’re going to get it’ in a real sinister way. The same way that Biden promised that he would stop NS2 from being used by Germany. For those interested, here is a long article about the background to the situation in Greenland-\nhttps://original.antiwar.com/Joseph_Terwilliger/2025/02/19/greenlandic-grievances-with-denmark-and-trump-annexation-plan/\nAfter their experiences with the Danes, I do not think that they will want to swap them for American masters. Just ask native Hawaiians how that is working out for them.\nRE:  Last night’s pretty-in-pink dem “protest”\nNew Mexico Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who chairs the Democratic Women’s Caucus, confirmed exclusively to TIME on Monday that the pink attire is meant to “signal our protest of Trump’s policies which are negatively impacting women and families.”\nMeanwhile, according to Fox “News,”\nNo Senate Democrat on Monday voted in favor of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would keep biological males from competing in women’s and girls’ sports.\nFox “News” goes on to say:\nMeanwhile, a recent New York Times/Ipsos poll found that the vast majority of Americans, including 67% of Democrats, don’t believe trans athletes should be able to compete in women’s sports. \nTHIS is also why “they” lost.\n(This and the fact that when DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old battling brain cancer who wants to be a cop when he grows up, was made an honorary secret service agent and no dem stood up and clapped for him.)  The dems are irredeemable.\nI think that most Democrats are actually graduates from the AOC School of Performative Theater. I have seen masses of Congresswomen in the past wearing white for some cause. Last year a lot of them were wearing yellow and blue to support the Ukraine. I think that years ago I even saw them in red, white and blue. It all means nothing but it makes them look like they are doing something heroic – while the cost of those outfits get claimed back on their tax forms. They should do what the Serbians are doing in their Parliament – chucking flares and smoke bombs. It would make for great TV watching-\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/613680-serbia-opposition-parliament-chaos/\nThey’re either graduates of the School of Performative Theater or graduates of one of the intel agencies/military.\nIt was funny watching Green be escorted out of the chamber while acting like a blue collar working being drug off a union picket line, shaking his cane at T.  Now that’s performative theater. / ;)\nI think it’s the other way around. AOC is a graduate of the Dem School of Performative Theater. ;)\n“It would make for great TV watching”\ncertainly more entertaining than yesterday´s horror show of ultimate boredom\nYes, I noticed this myself. None of the Dems had the good grace (or the working hips) to clap any of the Real Americans, even if their valour being honoured was theirs alone and being stolen by Trump. I think there were a few who clapped a cop and maybe the west Point kid but that could have been the Supreme Court who were ringside on that side.\nMaybe Trump should have brought in a fake president again.  If I remember right, the Democrats all got up and clapped the last time around when Trump showcased the would-be usurper Juan Guaido.\n“The hug”. Team blue wouldn’t stand and applaud if a cure for cancer walked through the door.  According to Fox, “Most Democrats appeared to remain sitting as a 13-year-old brain cancer survivor was asked to be made an honorary Secret Service agent, which led to swift criticism on X Tuesday night.”, Social media explodes after Dems do not stand for 13-year-old cancer survivor: ‘Truly sick people’. I’m curious as to which dems broke ranks.\nTrump started the speech by trolling the Dems on how Dems would oppose reflexively anything he did, said, or even complimented.  Looks like he read the state of things exactly right.  I got Rubio-in-2016 like vibes–remember how Rubio stumbled in the first debate exactly the way Trump trolled he would?  \nI would also add that Ames is right about Zelensky, but I doubt Trump is thinking he’s giving in.  Trump is probably giving Z just enough rope to hang himself with.  No matter what one thinks about Trump, he is very good at reading people.\nYeah, I watched it and that was my favorite part. This was Trump’s best moment and truly laugh out loud.\nAs his speech went on, it occurred to me that Biden is the gift that keeps on giving.\nNo they lost because they ignored inflation, the same thing that Trump is actively increasing due to his administration slapping tariffs on everyone, and immigration.\nWhat is really tragic is that Democrats made trans-gender people into a political football; On my weekly Pandemic Zoom call, at least several people are in or adjacent to this community themselves or their children, and they’re being actively terrorized by Trump’s policies. There’s real panic about being able to get passports with the correct gender, rumors of identifying documents being seized (not confirmed), and otherwise palpable fear.\nIf Democrats had just quietly supported some of the more reasonable positions, while acceding on the sports issue, maybe conservatives wouldn’t be all in on this.\nWhat a needless travesty.\nWatch out if you’re in a Democrat supported identity silo! You’re expendable.\nICAO is the standard for air traffic in the world, with US/FAA, in the past few decades, a bit slow on the uptake.\nUS had the theory early but implementation in air traffic like weapons seems to be less than advertised.\n…all real power is based on having an industrial base.\nThe people of the Rust Belt could have told the germans that a long time ago.\nIn fact, Andy Grove, former ceo of Intel (now deceased), DID say it in a classic essay 15 years ago.

They should wait a few months and then when Musk is flying into DC, the head of the FAA can ring him while he is flying. Tell Musk how grateful the FAA is for all Musk’s input and say how in fact his plane is being entirely guided by an AI with no human interference at all. That this AI is tasked with bringing his plane down (not literally) into DC and avoiding any Army helicopters or inbound & outbound aircraft so that his own plane does not end up in a ball of burning jet fuel. And that the FAA is now sure that they have gotten rid of all the bugs in the system and the way that the AI was hallucinating aircraft and mountains that were not there. I’m sure that Musk would be grateful for the news.\nRe: Trump post…arresting protestors\nIn the same camp with Bezos\nThere should be big pictures of Vance in clown make-up at that EU conference where he did all that talking about free speech.\nSame with thin-skinned Elon over at X.\nre: Democrats en Déshabillé\nI think it’s fair to say the Dems and DEI and lockdowns and mandates and not stopping Gaza got T elected.  Not that T won’t do bad stuff, but the last crew wouldn’t even let the Dems have a primary and just foisted the word-salad on their voters.  “Here.  Shut up and vote for this!”\nThe Dems response to T’s joint address to Congress was given by a Cheney approved, ex-CIA and intel operative now in Congress. Considered a rising star by the Dem estab. Yeah, the Dems aren’t talking to me. / ;)\nMaybe the Dems can make Liz Cheney their 2028 Democrat Presidential candidate.

As a general observation, I think we can safely say Slotkin represents team blue’s hope as they work to rebrand their operation.\nBiden on Ukraine with Harris unchanged….\nTo me we dodged nuke war bc Russia is saner than the united states’ war aka Democratic Party\nWow – was up till 4AM juiced and very disturbed from listening to T – the guy is a master who is only enhanced by the pathetic Democrats – i wasn’t going to listen but curiosity and that human trait to watch a fire that is destroying – lie after lie – promises totally unable to keep – gasoline on the fire of anger at the impotency most americans feel but most are unable to define why in any critical examination – the veiled threat about Greenland and implication of Panama – on and on, it seemed to never end – it is one thing to observe and criticize in an academic manner, but i have to admit that the effectiveness of T’s rhetorical propaganda is terrifying – i shouldn’t have watched but i did and now it is something i cannot unhear or unsee – i cannot afford nor at my age able to relocate out of this country and so i am stuck here – more fortunate than most in having a small orchard and a piece of land to grow food and flowers – if examined critically, where can you go……really? – i wish i was a religious man and believed in any god, i would be praying fervently for guidance – i do not have that luxury or belief – please do not suggest that there is such a haven – i won’t go on about this and my drug days are behind me and never was driven to alcohol so i am left to stew in the realization that we are seriously (familyblogged) – i am thankful for this blog and the commentariat to provide a glimmer that there is intelligence out there in the aether –\n“I don’t think people realize how incredible it is that a movie rendered in nearly real-time in free software on a single computer just won the Oscar for best animated film.

Last Sunday, the film “No Other Land” won Best Documentary. \nThe film, however, does not have a U.S. distributor. No studio or streaming service would touch it. The New York Times reported that this phenomenon is now common for many “topical documentaries.” That isn’t entirely true. Rather, movies critical of Israel’s human rights record are frequently censored by the U.S. film industry, a dynamic that uniquely suppresses this issue area from reaching American audiences. In fact, a documentary I worked on recently faced similar soft suppression.\nI also spoke to Jenin Younes, a civil liberties attorney who helped lead the challenge to the Biden administration on social media censorship. We discussed problems in the free speech movement and the failure to stand on principle for all victims of censorship, how some far left pro-Palestinian voices and pro-Israel advocates tend to both add to the problem of dehumanization and the path for peace.”\nIt’s time to say: And the Oscar goes to…. the Pentagon!\nI notice John Helmer has been making the alt media rounds talking about the math around what funding Ukraine has received.  This is the post he’s talking about:\nhttps://johnhelmer.net/ready-reckoner-for-president-donald-trumps-ukraine-war-fighting-war-funding-numbers-lies/\nBTW: Helmer has also been suggesting a major betrayal of Canada is underway.  I haven’t noticed anyone else that has made the same suggestion. But there it is…\nI read the article The Silicon Valley Consensus & AI Capex and it that left me scratching my head, particularly in its opening sections. The author suggests that certain technologies are being sustained through overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting in order to achieve excessive gains and wield political power to reshape society. \nAs the article states:  \non sustaining a certain technology through a frenzy of overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting in order to realize excessive gains that can be translated into political power aimed at restructuring society.\nHowever, I found it lacking in explanation on how these investments would ultimately generate real profits. If AI companies are indeed overbuilding, they will inevitably have to absorb the losses – there’s no magical way to convert poor decisions into gains. \nThis echoes a point we’ve made before in our piece Are We Overbuilding, where we argue that players may be falling into the trap of overexpansion. \nOne valid point the article makes is that AI has yet to produce its “killer app”. I explored this idea in a recent post, The Killer AI App is You, which may be of interest to readers. \nOverall, while the article comes across as somewhat rambling and unfocused, it’s clear that the author has a significant following – a testament to their reach and influence. \nI’m thinking the “AI” killer app is large scale population surveillance and control.\n>EU States Secretly ‘Happy’ for Hungary, Slovakia To Block Ukraine Aid\nMy guess is that EU leaders’ opposition to Trump is superficial.

Simply put, the review is not exhaustive and is not focused on T cell dysregulation, that topic is beyond the scope of the review, and indeed, there are papers in a separate field of sorts that do cover this.\nMy specialization was T cell death and aging itself, and I posited and discovered a shared mechanism of death and differentiation in 2011.\nI will address the claim of no harm to t cells here:\nThe claim that “COVID does not harm T cells” can be directly challenged by evidence from several studies.\nBoluarte accuses Public Prosecutor’s Office of attempted “coup attempt” after raid on Interior Minister’s home –\n CNN\nPedro Castillo’s trial begins for the self-coup d’état in Peru: “I never committed a crime of rebellion” – El País\nWhat the hell is going on in Peru?\nhttps://www.thespec.com/news/world/americas/peruvian-ex-president-castillo-is-on-trial-for-a-failed-attempt-to-dissolve-congress/article_98196ccc-9c61-50f1-ab21-cf27d2679595.html\nI had to bring myself up to date.  Summarizing, Pedro Castillo was a mestizo schoolteacher whom Peru mistakenly elected president in 2021.  Parliament tried on several occasions to rectify the matter by impeaching Castillo.  On their third try, a desperate Castillo attempted to dissolve Congress and call for new elections in late 2022.  He was promptly arrested by the military and is now coming to trial. Mexico, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Colombia still recognize Castillo as President of Peru.\nSure, but now a series of press and prosecutorial pressures seem to suggest that President Baluarte (Castillo’s former vice-president) is no longer the symbol of a supposed “democratic transition”, after the Peruvian oligarchy conspired to overthrow the professor. \nThis has been brewing for months. From France 24, Peru’s prosecutors file constitutional complaint against President Boluarte over Rolexgate case.\nThank you. I’m only a casual student of Latin American politics, so as your link above was to an El Pais story translated from the Polish, it didn’t bring me up to date. \nSince Boluarte previously identified as ‘a Marxist’, it seems the case that either she is being lawfared over a Rolodex, or she is a Peruvian AOC. I, too, would appreciate more backstory.\nNor am I an expert on Latin American politics. What I comment here is only an approximation subject to the margins of a manichean press. So don’t expect much rigor. Wikipedia seems to have done a decent profile of Boluarte. I recommend it. (Although, if you ask me, a politician investigated for the defile of rolexes and jewelry he flaunted in his public appearances is perhaps not the best sign of ideological coherence. Peru Libre hosted a large amalgam of “leftist” politicians for the elections that saw Castillo as the winner, and clearly this was a double-edged sword. On the other hand, certain coincidences with what is happening in Bolivia are disturbing).\nAn RT article today has this headline and subheading:  “EU publisher pulls Vance’s book:\nA Lithuanian publishing house has recalled the US vice president’s novel in protest of Washington’s policy turn away from Kiev.”\nThroughout the short article “Hillbilly Elegy” is referred to as J.D.

It can be true that “Russiagate” was a big smear job/con job and it can also be true at the same time that Russia would have intelligence officers operating in the United States and that the FBI would like to monitor them as before.\n   Back when it was revealed that the US was spying on EUropean leaders, including Angela Merkel herself, some of Colonel Lang’s readers decried and condemned “spying on our loyal allies” . . . to the point where the Colonel himself felt compelled to write ( and I paraphrase) . . . ” come on, grow up and stop being children.   Every government spies on every other government including its closest allies.    That is what governments are supposed to do.”\n    He then went on to write, and I remember this quote exactly . . . ” I don’t mind what Jonathan Pollard did.   I mind that he did it TO US.”\nSusan Abulhawa is missing a wider deeper point about ” what makes University protests illegal” and also misses the wider deeper goal.    Does she know about the history of protest and protest-suppression at American Universities and colleges in the 60’s and early 70’s?\n   The deeper goal is to attack the Universities themselves, especially the ones which Assistant Vice President Vance hates personally-ideologically.    Here is a 30 minute speech by J. D. Vance given at the\nNational Conservatism Conference II.    It is titled:  ” The Universities are the Enemy”.\nHere is the link.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FR65Cifnhw\n    The Trump/Vance Administration’s proximate goal is ” Two, Three, Many Kent States”.\nThe mid-range goal is to bankrupt and liquidate those universities and colleges designated “deepest blue enemies”.   The longest-range goal is a Great Conservative Cultural Revolution in every University and College which they haven’t chosen ( or are not able) to liquidate.

Johnson’s office also confirmed the incident.\nOne of the sources told NBC News that a police report indicated that Haynes hit a Capitol vehicle around midnight and was arrested and released with a citation to appear in court. The arrest came after Trump’s speech Tuesday night, when Johnson presided over the House floor and sat just behind the president’s left shoulder.\n“A driver backed into a parked vehicle last night around 11:40 p.m.,” the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. “We responded and arrested them for DUI.”\nRemember that all of these things T wants  done:  mining in Ukraine, Greenland, cut all the trees, pipeline in alaska, new chip factories, more drilling  etc all will take lots of years if ever to build.\nAnd who’s going to cut the trees, hail the trees and what log mills are  left to mill them?

Suffice to say, the US seems to be cutting itself free from longstanding joint operations with Britain directed against Russia.”\nHe’s saying that the “firewall” is against British meddling in US foreign policy and relations with Russia.

            "full_content": "Stocks dropped again Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s tariffs sparked queasiness on Wall Street, sending two major indexes to their lowest levels since before the November election.\nTraders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.\nThe S&P 500, the most commonly cited U.S. stock benchmark, fell 1.2% Tuesday, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.6%, or 670 points, and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq dipped 0.4%.\nThe S&P and Nasdaq closed at their lowest levels since Nov. 4, the day before Election Day, while the Dow closed at its lowest level since Jan. 14.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge as it tracks moves in S&P options trading, rose Tuesday to its highest level since mid December.\nEquities came back in afternoon trading, as the Dow and S&P trimmed losses to just a 0.3% daily loss by about 3:30 p.m. EST, while the Nasdaq rose 0.7%, before all turned sharply negative.\nBank of America, Tesla, JPMorgan Chase and Disney were among the big name stocks which declined at least 3%.\nThe S&P suffered its worst loss of 2025 on Monday. Most of the selloff followed Trump’s confirmation he planned to enact his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, levies which went into effect Tuesday morning.\n“Markets dislike uncertainty,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategist Daniel Skelly wrote in emailed comments ahead of the turnaround. In a prescient morsel of hope, Skelly continued, “it remains to be seen whether some of the bearishness surrounding these tariffs will dissipate now that they’ve actually been implemented.”\nThe Nasdaq was on the cusp of entering a 10% correction, trading as much as 9.9% below its record close last month. Following the afternoon recovery, the Nasdaq is down 8.8% from its peak.\nTesla, the electric vehicle firm run by Trump’s top lieutenant Elon Musk, also the world’s richest man, closed nearly 45% below its record high set in December.\nTariffs can hurt companies’ financial performance in several ways. If American consumers curtail spending in response to higher prices, that would eat into revenue. If companies absorb the costs of tariffs, that would cut into domestic profit margins. If companies’ goods sold abroad are priced less competitively in response to any retaliatory tariffs, that may hurt non-U.S. sales. Stocks are already valued at a historically stretched ratio compared to earnings, a recipe for vulnerability upon an event shaking market confidence.\nThe 10% duty on Chinese goods will boost U.S. core prices by 0.1% and the 25% levy on Canadian and Mexican imports will up core prices by 0.6%, estimated Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips in a Monday note to clients. A roughly 0.7% increase to core prices would reverse recent progress on inflation, which has been above the 2% ideal level for nearly four years straight.\nOne Community.

            "full_content": "Jade Cargill (Photo by WWE/Getty Images)\nSo, it really was Naomi who attacked Jade Cargill in November 2024.\nCargill had been off WWE programming rehabbing a real injury and honing her skills, but the promotion cooked up an awesome storyline to explain her absence.\nCargill returned with a vengeance at Elimination Chamber on March 1. She attacked Naomi at the start of the match, slamming her head in the chamber door before exiting while Bianca Belair—her former tag team partner—watched in horror from her pod.\nThe revenge attack was pulled off in a way that left some doubt as to whether Cargill had targeted the right person. Based on the confession Naomi gave in the middle of the ring on Friday Night SmackDown, it appears Cargill got the culprit.\nNaomi confessed to attacking Cargill. She said she wished she had pushed her harder and called Belair an “ungrateful b****” before Cargill arrived and set off another beating on her attacker.\nTake a look at the scene. Note the attires and the messaging being delivered with every ounce of the visuals.\nBianca began the segment dressed modestly, almost as if she was in mourning. It was a solid touch, considering she was supposed to be distraught over the discord between mutual friends.\nShe might have struggled a bit at the beginning of the mic work, but she found her stride a little earlier than midway through the promo. Once Naomi got there, business picked up, and so did the overall quality of the segment.\nNaomi dug deep. The underrated WWE veteran mustered up real tears, voice breaks, and the kind of posture befitting the situation. I’m not sure what place Naomi had to go to mentally to convey this emotion, but she did it.\nSensing the challenge from her friend and counterpart, Bianca upped her game and found her groove. Naomi became appropriately more vicious as the desperation set in, with Bianca turning her back on her.\nOnce Cargill arrived, she walked past Bianca in a way that suggested there was still tension between the two former partners. When she reached Naomi, all hell broke loose, and Cargill ended the segment by hitting Jaded on the turncoat, who masterfully called out “Bianca!” as she was face-first on her way to the canvas.\nPHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - MARCH 07: Jade Cargill with Jaded on Naomi during SmackDown at the ... More Wells Fargo Center on March 7, 2025 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Craig Melvin/WWE via Getty Images)\nSomething tells me there is more on the way from this angle. I don’t believe it will be as simple as a Naomi heel turn and that’s it. I predict Cargill will also turn—or, if I stick to my original prediction, Bianca could still be the mastermind behind it all.\nIf there is something I’d like to see, it’s some incorporation of Montez Ford, Bianca’s real-life husband, into her story. That angle hasn’t ever been explored, and it seems like a good time to see if there is some life there.\nIn any case, this was good work and more strong storytelling from WWE. The promotion is on fire right now. Enjoy it, wrestling fans."

More 2023 at Bramham Park on August 27, 2023 in Leeds, England. (Photo by Katja Ogrin/Redferns)\nAfter teasing new music over the last couple weeks, the sensational anonymous UK outfit Sleep Token has finally released ‘a new offering.’ “Emergence” is the band’s new single and their first release since their 2023 critically acclaimed LP, Take Me Back To Eden. \nWith the release of “Emergence,” Sleep Token has also announced their forthcoming studio album, Even In Arcadia, which is set to release May 9th. The band’s upcoming fourth studio album will see them embark on a massive U.S. arena tour in support of this new era.\nSimply put, \"Emergence\" is another great offering from Sleep Token. The track doesn’t exactly see the band explore any brand new sonic territory, but rather it sees them expand on their unique blend of Djenty guitars and alternative metal aesthetics that fans have come to know them by.\nLike a number of Sleep Token tracks, “Emergence” is a very dynamic song. It starts off with some somber melodies and a beautiful piano layer, and it slowly begins to take flight with a hip-hop-like section which later climaxes into a satisfying Djenty breakdown.\nApart from “Emergence” just being a solid single, one of the most notable sonic aspects of the song is the Saxophone solo featured towards the end. It’s hard to imagine that Sleep Token fans won’t be pleased with “Emergence,” but it’ll be interesting to see how else Sleep Token can expand and differentiate their sound on the upcoming LP.\nEarlier this week many U.S. venues looked as if they were teasing an imminent Sleep Token tour announcement, with some venues taking to social media to show off the band’s logo on their websites. Well it looks like all that was suspected is now true, and Sleep Token are in fact hitting the road again for a massive U.S. arena tour later this year. The band’s tour will kickoff on September 16th in Duluth, Georgia and conclude on October 11th, in Los Angeles, California. Below is the full list of dates for the band’s 2025 U.S. tour:\nSeptember 16, 2025 - Duluth, GA - Gas South Arena\nSeptember 17, 2025 - Orlando, FL - Kia Center\nSeptember 19, 2025 - Louisville, KY - Louder Than Life*\nSeptember 20, 2025 – Greensboro, NC - First Horizon Coliseum\nSeptember 22, 2025 - Brooklyn, NY - Barclays Center\nSeptember 23, 2025 - Worcester, MA - DCU Center\nSeptember 24, 2025 - Philadelphia, PA - Wells Fargo Center\nSeptember 26, 2025 - Detroit, MI - Little Caesars Arena\nSeptember 27, 2025 - Cleveland, OH - Rocket Arena\n  September 28, 2025 - Rosemont, IL - Allstate Arena\nSeptember 30, 2025 - Lincoln, NE - Pinnacle Bank Arena\nOctober 1, 2025 - Minneapolis, MN - Target Center\nOctober 3, 2025 - Denver, CO - Ball Arena\nOctober 5, 2025 - West Valley City, UT - Maverik Center\nOctober 7, 2025 - Tacoma, WA - Tacoma Dome\nOctober 8, 2025 - Portland, OR - Moda Center\nOctober 10, 2025 - Oakland, CA - Oakland Arena\nOctober 11, 2025 - Los Angeles, CA - Crypto.com Arena\nWith Sleep Token’s new era now revealed their 2025 has now only gotten more ambitious. “Emergence” shows early and promising signs that the band has cooked up another satisfying LP, and the band’s upcoming tour highlights the fact that Sleep Token is without a doubt one of the most popularized metal bands of this decade. All this alongside with the fact the band will be headlining Download for the very first time, 2025 is set to be Sleep Token’s biggest and possibly the most important year in their career."

            "full_content": "A Friday rally was not enough to reverse a brutal start to March for U.S. stocks, as investors digested a barrage of economic data and policies from President Donald Trump, particularly the uncertainty of his extensive tariffs on the country’s top three trade partners.\nIt's a red March thus far in the stock market.\nThe most widely followed American stock index, the S&P 500 (down 3.1% since last Friday) registered its worst weekly losses since the week ending Sept. 6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 2.4%) suffered its worst loss since February.\nThat came even as the Dow rose 0.5%, or 220 points, and the S&P gained 0.6% in Friday trading as February’s jobs report came in just shy of economist forecasts.The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.\nThe S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies with a median market capitalization of about $1 billion, suffered even bigger percentage losses this week, as the Nasdaq fell 3.5% to its lowest end-of-week price since early October and the Russell sank 3.9% to its lowest level since June.\nDriving the losses were flipflops from Trump on tariffs, as his 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% additional duty on Chinese imports went into effect Tuesday, before delaying most of the Canadian and Mexican tariffs until April on Thursday, and then teasing new tariffs on some Canadian goods Friday.\n“I’m not even looking at the market,” Trump said Thursday, before adding there will be “a little short-term interruption.”\nMore than $3 trillion. That’s how much market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its Feb. 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data, as the index fell 6%.\nIn terms of market value lost, Elon Musk’s car company Tesla and artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia are the two biggest losers dating back to Feb. 19, as Nvidia lost $712 billion in market cap and Tesla $322 billion in that timeframe. In addition to Nvidia and Tesla, a slew of big-name companies suffered 8% or greater stock selloffs this week, including American Express, Bank of America, Boeing, Citigroup, Costco, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Netflix and Wells Fargo.\nBeyond the likely negative impact on corporate earnings, at least in the short term, of tariffs, the constantly shifting tariff implementation dates and exceptions have led to heightened uncertainty, something investors largely despise.  “It seems as if there have been very few times in markets where one has to interpret so much disparate, and at times conflicting, data relative to the economy and influences on it,” Rick Rieder, the head of BlackRock’s global allocation investment team, wrote to clients Friday. Stocks initially soared after Trump’s November win, as the Dow tacked on about 3,000 points in the three weeks after the election, gains spurred by prevailing hopes of corporate tax cuts and more lax regulations, before sentiment soured as Trump enacted his economic agenda. Trump’s “policies appear to be tilting towards a less business-friendly stance,” remarked JPMorgan Chase economists Bruce Kasman and Joseph Lupton in a Friday note. The S&P is down about 4% dating back to Trump’s January inauguration.\nOne Community.

(“Wholesale”) recorded certain calls to California residents without disclosing the fact that the call was being recorded in violation of Sections 632 and 632.7 of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (“CIPA”).”\nBesides suffering the financial hit, The Credit Wholesale Company will also be required to reform its practices.\n“In addition to monetary relief, Defendant Wholesale has agreed not to record appointment-setting calls to California businesses unless it discloses at the outset of the call that the call is being recorded.”\nThe court preliminarily approved the settlement on January 24th and the final approval hearing is scheduled for May 20th. Class members, who include businesses and individuals that received telephone calls from the Wells Fargo service provider between October 22nd of 2014 and November 17th of 2023, are required to submit their claims by April 11th.\nGenerated Image: Midjourney\nCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.\nBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •\nAltcoins • Futuremash • Financeflux •\nBlockchain • Regulators • Scams •\nHodlX • Press Releases\nABOUT US | EDITORIAL POLICY | PRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS  | CONTACT | ADVERTISE\nCOPYRIGHT © 2017-2025 THE DAILY HODL\n© 2025 The Daily Hodl"

Tesla’s future looks grim. \nby  Andrew J. Hawkins\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nTesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly. \nBut at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back. \n“I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. “Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”\nBut it will probably take more than a Cybertruck in the presidential motorcade to make Tesla great again. It will take an actual commitment to more affordable electric vehicles. It will take a more serious and safer approach to driverless cars. And it may take a change of leadership to get the company back on track. Let’s run down the company’s problems.\nTrump’s election last year sent Tesla’s stock price soaring, as investors rewarded Musk for making the right political bet. It hit a record high of $488 in mid-December; by early March, it had sunk to roughly $226. \nThe wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, Tesla’s steepest drop in years. Musk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit. (But don’t worry: he’s still the richest man in the world.)\nWhat happened? Setting Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) side quest and the resulting protests aside for a moment, the simplest explanation is that Tesla’s sales suck. The company produced 4 percent fewer cars in 2024 than it did the previous year. And its deliveries were essentially flat. Tesla earnings came in light, even with a Bitcoin boost.\nMusk’s own net worth took an over $100 billion hit.\nIn California, Tesla’s biggest market in the US, its sales dropped almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 12 percent for the year. Coastal elites’ love affair with the brand has soured. \nAnd it’s not just in the US. In February, Tesla’s sales were down 10 percent in Spain, 42 percent in Sweden, 45 percent in France, 48 percent in Norway and Denmark, 53 percent in Portugal, 55 percent in Italy, and a whopping 76 percent in Germany. Musk’s endorsement may have helped Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party place second in the recent election, but it doesn’t seem to have improved his company’s flagging sales in Europe — down 45 percent in January year over year. \nIn China, the world’s largest car market, Tesla is on a sustained losing streak. The company has been backsliding for the past five consecutive months on a year-on-year basis, according to data from the country’s Passenger Car Association. Some of this is likely related to a temporary factory suspension to accommodate the new Model Y Juniper assembly line, but rising competition from domestic automakers like BYD is putting increased pressure on Tesla. \nAnd unlike BYD, Tesla doesn’t sell any hybrid vehicles. It has nothing to fall back on when consumers feel anxious about the future of electric vehicles.\nA frequent criticism you see about Tesla is that the company’s vehicle lineup is getting a little long in the tooth. The Model X turns 10 this year, while the Model S is pushing 15. Both vehicles have only received minor updates since their initial launch. (A Tesla executive promised a refresh later this year.)\nThe Model 3 and Model Y, which represent the bulk of the company’s automotive revenues, were both updated recently, but the lag in regular updates has opened a window of opportunity for Tesla’s competitors. Consumers interested in plug-in power suddenly have a wealth of choices as newer, more interesting EVs from Hyundai, Kia, Honda, and General Motors hit the market. \nMeanwhile, Tesla’s only new model to be introduced in the last five years is the Cybertruck, which has been recalled seven times since its launch. Musk has said that frequent software updates obviate the need for a more regular cadence of model refreshes. \nWhile Tesla sales dropped, sales of non-Tesla EVs continued to climb. Americans bought a record 1.3 million electric cars, an increase of 7.3 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book. EVs now claim 8.1 percent of the market in the US. \nAmericans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. \nFor years, Musk has been promising to make an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000. He first mentioned it in a 2018 interview, saying, “A $25,000 car, that’s something we can do.” Then, in 2020, at the company’s first Battery Day event, he speculated that Tesla could eventually produce upward of 20 million of these vehicles in a year — or roughly twice the current production of Toyota, GM, or Volkswagen.\nMusk has said the more affordable EV would be built on the company’s next-generation vehicle platform. But rather than prioritize a vehicle that investors took to calling the “Model 2,” he spent Tesla’s resources on the expensive, polarizing Cybertruck. And after some initial excitement, the truck has turned into a flop. Musk predicted that Tesla would eventually sell 500,000 Cybertrucks a year. Last year, the company only sold an estimated 40,000. \nAmericans aren’t souring on electric vehicles — they’re just over Tesla. \nMusk has also actively gummed up the works for a cheaper Tesla vehicle. Last year, he reportedly canceled the company’s plans to build a low-cost electric vehicle in favor of going all in on a robotaxi. But after some pushback, he claimed that a cheaper Tesla was back on the menu — only now, the vehicles are expected to be built on the same platform as the Model 3 and Model Y. Now, investors are worried that this new vehicle will cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales rather than boost the company’s profits overall. \nMeanwhile, Kia and Volkswagen have announced plans to actually produce affordable EVs. And China has cracked the code on budget-priced, highly affordable EVs. The BYD Seagull, for example, was the country’s bestselling vehicle last summer, with about 190 miles of range and a sticker price of around $10,000. Even with a 100 percent tariff, the Seagull would still sell for a price much cheaper than most US-made EVs.\nOf course, Musk doesn’t think Tesla even needs a $25,000 vehicle. The company’s future is in AI — specifically self-driving cars and humanoid robots. In October 2024, he undercut his company’s own guidance to make “affordable models” by commenting, “I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. It would be silly. It would be completely at odds with what we believe.”\nMusk now believes that Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy. He’s claimed that fully autonomous vehicles are right around the corner for almost a decade now. “Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue,” he said during the most recent earnings call, referring to Tesla’s humanoid robots. \n“I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless.”\nBut while Musk bloviates about robots, Waymo and others are operating real driverless cars on the road. The Alphabet-owned company just launched its first partnership with Uber in Austin, Texas — Tesla’s headquarters and the city where Musk has said he plans on launching his own robotaxi project this summer. \nThere’s little evidence that Tesla is on the cusp of delivering what Waymo has already done. The promise that all Tesla vehicles built after 2016 have the hardware necessary for full self-driving turned out to be totally false. Musk said the company would replace the onboard computers for vehicle owners who bought the FSD package, a process he admitted would be “painful.” Tesla has already been targeted with a class action lawsuit claiming the company lied about the capabilities of its vehicles. \nAnd then there’s Elon. And DOGE. And the fascist salute. And the chainsaw. And everything else going on behind those dark sunglasses. \nMusk’s antics have turned the Tesla brand toxic. Disillusioned owners are selling their vehicles at big losses. Others are swapping in badges from other vehicle brands or using desperate-sounding stickers to signal their dissatisfaction with the billionaire CEO. \nAnd even more are protesting outside Tesla showrooms as part of a grassroots effort to oppose Musk’s takeover of the federal government, damage the company’s stock price, and maybe even slash the world’s richest man’s net worth. \nSeparately, there have been a growing number of reports of arson and vandalism at the company’s stores. Tesla charging stations have been set on fire. A showroom in Oregon was shot up. A woman was arrested in Colorado for throwing a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla location. Tesla vehicles have been defaced with swastikas and expletives. Four Cybertrucks were destroyed in a fire in Seattle. The rage is real. \nKeep in mind, Tesla’s sales were already dropping before all these incidents occurred. The growing dissatisfaction has led some analysts to predict even more dire numbers for the company’s first quarter results this spring. \nIt’s unclear what can turn the company’s fortunes around. Some supporters have started to openly question whether Tesla can continue to survive with Musk at the helm. But shareholders aren’t likely to jettison the controversial CEO yet, especially after voting to approve his multibillion-dollar pay package last summer. The outcome was a huge vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership — and a big validator of his behavior. \nBut that was pre-DOGE, before the salute, and before the stock wipeout. Tesla’s board is clearly feeling the pinch. Chair Robyn Denholm and director James Murdoch (son of Rupert Murdoch) both sold millions of dollars’ worth of shares in the past month. \nA lot rests on Musk’s promises of a cheaper Tesla, a next-generation vehicle platform, and an actual working robotaxi service. President Trump can buy all the Teslas he wants, but if Tesla’s future is built on a bunch of falsehoods and fantasies, it’s unlikely the company can emerge from this fire unscathed.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "The Tesla Takedown movement is rallying against Elon Musk, and it’s only getting bigger.\nThe Tesla Takedown movement is rallying against Elon Musk, and it’s only getting bigger.\nToday we’re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake. \nA lot of people are deeply unhappy with this state of affairs. And because Musk is not an elected official but is, on some level, a car salesman, many of those frustrated and angry people are taking aim at the most visible and accessible symbol of his power and wealth: Tesla itself.\nThere are protests at Tesla showrooms and charging stations every weekend now, and they’re only getting bigger — and attracting police presence and threats of prosecution from the government. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have said that any violence aimed at Tesla vehicles or property would be prosecuted as domestic terrorism. This is very Trump, in that there is not actually a specific federal domestic terrorism law, but you know… Trump.\nIn any case, these protests seem like they’re working; Tesla’s stock price has been sinking, new car registrations are down, and merely owning one has become uncomfortably political for a lot of people. We’re also seeing the hype around the company fading in ways that are frankly surprising — popular YouTubers are pointing out that vehicles like the Cybertruck simply aren’t very good and that Tesla’s missed ship dates and big claims about the capabilities of its self-driving tech don’t really hold up. And if the hype fades enough, it’s possible to break Tesla itself — it’s sky-high stock price is entirely based on hype, after all.\nTo help pull this all apart, I asked Ed Niedermeyer to join me on the show. Niedermeyer published a book about Tesla in 2019 called Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, and he hosts a podcast called Autonocast, about autonomous vehicle technology. His sizable following on Bluesky has also made him one of the leading organizers of the Tesla protests in Portland, Oregon, where he lives. So I wanted to bring him on the show to talk me through what he sees with both the big picture of Tesla as a company and on the ground with the ongoing protest movement.\nThere’s a lot happening and the story is changing fast, even since Niedermeyer and I talked at the beginning of the week. But that bigger picture — the disconnect between what he calls the “myth” of Tesla and the reality, and how that reality is now manifesting into a global protest movement — is shaping up to be the defining story of Tesla’s next chapter.\nIf you’d like to read more about what we talked about in this episode, check out the links below:\nQuestions or comments about this episode?

            "full_content": "Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a taxi service in California, a spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission, a state regulator, said Tuesday. It marks the first step towards Tesla’s and CEO Elon Musk’s vision of operating a driverless taxi service in the state.\nOne day, Musk has said, Tesla owners should be able to rent out their cars as sort of self-driving Ubers while they’re not using them. He has said current owners should be able to operate their Models 3 and Y autonomously in the state later this year—a plan that faces both technological and regulatory hurdles.\nBut despite the permit, Tesla’s driverless taxi future still seems far off in California, which has the perfect climate for self-driving cars but some of the strictest regulatory requirements in the US for testing and operating them. The permit does not allow Tesla to transport passengers in driverless cars; CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper says that the electric carmaker did not apply for its autonomous vehicle programs. Tesla wouldn't be granted such a permit anyway, because it first needs to receive permission from another state regulator, the Department of Motor Services, to offer driverless rides. (The DMV confirmed to WIRED that Tesla has not applied for the necessary permits.)\nThe new permit does allow Tesla to operate a taxi service comprising vehicles with drivers, who will be Tesla employees, according to the CPUC. Initially, the regulator says, Tesla will use the permit to take only Tesla employees on prearranged trips, though it plans to eventually give rides to members of the public.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the permit, or its future driverless plans in California.\nFour companies, including Amazon’s Zoox, hold permits allowing them to operate some kind of driverless service pilot in the state, though two of those companies are only permitted to offer rides with a driver behind the wheel. Only Waymo operates driverless taxis in California. The Google sister company, which took a longer and more cautious approach to self-driving service, spent more than a decade moving from testing early versions of its driverless technology on public roads to running a paid robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Today, Waymo operates service in four cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.\nTesla has explored launching a driverless taxi service in at least Palo Alto, Palo Alto Online first reported last year. Emails later obtained by WIRED show that, by late October of last year, Tesla Autopilot head Ashok Elluswamy was negotiating with city council and staff members over how to pull off such a service. Tesla had hoped to launch by taking over the same permit used by another company, Via, that provided shuttle services in California. Eventually, according to the emails, the automaker concluded that it had to apply for its own permit.\nA spokesperson for the City of Palo Alto did not immediately respond to questions about how the new permit might affect robotaxi plans in the area.\nMusk said earlier this year that Tesla plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Austin, Texas, this coming June. (Unlike California, Texas has no strict rules around autonomous vehicle operations.) Last fall, the automaker showed off a prototype of its “Cybercab,” a two-seat, purpose-built robotaxi, which it said it would begin to produce in 2026.\nWhatever happens in Texas this year, Musk and his company have already missed a few deadlines. In 2019, he said the automaker would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the following year.\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\nDOGE takeover: Elon Musk’s toxicity could spell disaster for Tesla\nBig Story: A crypto crimefighter’s descent into Nigerian prison\nI dated multiple AI partners at once.

Hawkins\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nFord is making some changes to how it handles its EV charging accessories.\nThe company was the first to announce its plans to adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector for its EVs, and was also first to distribute NACS adapters to its EV customers free of charge. But now that grace period is over, with Ford announcing that it has finally shipped adapters to all 140,000 customers that reserved one.\nStarting today, anyone that needs a NACS adapter will have to shell out $200. The adapters were co-developed by Ford and Lectron, and are rated for up to 500 amps and 1,000 volts. The adapters went through a battery of tests, including being run over by a truck and submerging them in water, to be sure they were up to the task of connecting Ford EVs to Tesla Superchargers.\nStarting today, anyone that needs a NACS adapter will have to shell out $200.\nFord has been struggling with delays and recalls in getting its adapters to customers. The deadline to receive a complimentary adapter was extended several times. And Ford also had tell its customers to stop using the adapter after discovering an issue with the charging speed. (Lectron said only a small batch of adapters were effected.) To deal with these shortages, Ford started offering its own Lectron-developed adapters last year as it waited for Tesla’s supply to catch up.\nIn a blog post, Ford’s head of charging and energy service Ken Williams extended his gratitude to everyone who waited for a complimentary charger: “Every complimentary adapter reserved by our U.S. customers has been shipped. From customer reservation No. 1 in Austin, Texas, to customer reservation #139,936 in Waconia, Minnesota, we are truly grateful for those who have charged with us (and patiently waited for us).”\nFord also touted the growth of its BlueOval Charging Network, which now includes Tesla’s Supercharger destinations as among the stations where Ford EV owners can pay for charging using their Ford Pass app. The network now includes more than 180,000 chargers at more than 50,000 charging locations, representing a 40 percent increase from early 2024.\nThe company is making other updates to help its customers use Tesla’s EV charging stations. EV owners who use Apple Maps via CarPlay will now be routed to nearby Superchargers when planning a trip that will require charging, Ford said.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Hawkins\nTesla is planning to install dozens of Supercharger sites at Steak ‘n Shake locations across the country, according to an exchange between the companies on X. The companies have signed an agreement for over six sites, with over 20 more to come. And if Steak ‘n Shake gets its way, possibly 100 restaurants will see future Supercharger installations.\nThe way the news trickled out was a little weird, yet typical of how Elon Musk likes to use his social media platform, X, to publicize new information about his various companies.\nIt started with seed oils\nIt started with a post about how Steak ’n Shake was switching from seed oils to beef tallow to cook its french fries, referencing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly made controversial claims about seed oils. (We don’t have to get into all that now.)\nMusk, a major Trump supporter who is fronting the DOGE-led effort to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, replied to the post that “the fries taste way better!” Steak ’n Shake responded by thanking him and asking whether Tesla planned on installing charging stations at its restaurants. To which Tesla’s Supercharger account replied:\nSteak ‘n Shake responded again, suggesting 100 locations could serve as Supercharger sites.\nTesla has formed partnerships with restaurant and convenience store chains in the past, including Ruby Tuesday and Sheetz. The company is also currently building its own 1950s-style diner and drive-in movie theater, with over 30 charging stalls.\nTesla likely won’t be able to rely on federal funding for any new charging locations, after the Trump administration halted a $5 billion federal program to install new EV chargers. Tesla has received $31 million in funds from the program to install 539 DC fast-charging ports, which represents 6 percent of all funds distributed so far, according to a dashboard that tracks the spending.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

The billionaire’s America PAC is claiming to give $100 to registered voters who sign a petition against “activist judges.”\nIt’s not the first time Musk has promised money in exchange for signatures on petitions: he did the same thing leading up to the presidential election in November. It’s illegal to pay someone to vote or to register to vote, but Musk’s approach is meant to intentionally toe the line. Some election law experts say the tactic is legal because the offer doesn’t require a person actually vote; others say that requiring signatories be registered voters is what violates the law.\nOn April 1st Wisconsin voters will elect a new state Supreme Court justice, determining whether liberals will hold on to their 4-3 majority and rule on key issues like abortion, public sector unions, and gerrymandering. More than $76 million has been poured into the record breaking race already, with Musk-affiliated groups spending more than $14 million to try to elect conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who is trailing Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in the race. Liberal mega donors have also jumped in, with donations to the Wisconsin Democratic Party coming from individuals like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.\nMusk and his America PAC have no way of confirming people who signed the petition actually voted — instead, they get voter contact information. Signing the petition requires people to share their first and last name, email, phone number, and mailing address, meaning the PAC can target voters in the weeks leading up to the election. The petition itself doesn’t mention Musk, Trump, or Schimel by name, but with a rolodex of registered voters in Wisconsin, the America PAC can urge those signatories to get out and vote for Musk (and Trump’s) favored candidate.\nDespite Musk’s railing against “activist judges,” Schimel is a longtime, vocal Trump supporter, even dressing as him for Halloween last year. As The New York Times reported, Schimel has parroted Trump’s lies about “rigged” elections and campaigned with the president, injecting unabashedly partisan politics into a race for a nonpartisan seat.\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is also personal for Musk outside of politics: Tesla is suing the state. In 2024, Wisconsin blocked Tesla from opening dealerships in the state, in line with a law that prohibits manufacturers from operating dealerships. In January Musk posted on X: “Very important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!” He referenced an election conspiracy theory about voting in his post.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nThe road to progress has never been smooth. Witness, as a metaphor, the trials and tribulations of the Ford Motor Company as it has tried to sell electric vehicle drivers the premier charging experience: an easy, friction-free, and maybe even delightful pit stop that might convince even more buyers to dump their gas-guzzlers for the plug.\nHowever, Ford announced today that, a year after saying it would give away electric vehicle charging adapters to qualifying customers, it has finally made good on this promise.\nFord says it has sent out 140,000 fast-charging adapters, allowing thousands of model year 2021 to 2024 Mach-E and Lighting drivers to access the Tesla Supercharger network. Now customers have access to 44,000 fast chargers across North America—up 53 percent from a year ago—which can charge up a car in as little as 20 minutes. In total, North American Ford drivers can now access 180,000 chargers, which the company says makes it the continent’s largest integrated public charging network.\nBefore the 2-pound adapter could show up in drivers’ mailboxes, Ford went through a nearly two-year odyssey of changes, delays, a few manufacturing missteps, and a low-grade kerfuffle with Tesla, still the country’s most dominant EV manufacturer. The whole thing is a microcosm of the wider challenges that face car manufacturers as they attempt to ride the whims of global markets and policy to transition to electric vehicles. It echoes, too, Ford’s stop-starts in its own EV rollout, which have included production delays and pauses, difficulty in bringing down the costs of production, and last summer’s announcement that the company would rejigger its electrification strategy to emphasize hybrids over battery-electrics, canceling one electric SUV and delaying another EV in the process.\nFord says getting this adapter and public charging right is vital because most of the company’s EV customers are now people switching from gas-powered cars. \"We know that making the charging experience work better is just going to make them feel better about their purchase,” says CEO Jim Farley. Hooking up with Tesla’s Supercharger network, long regarded as the most reliable and built-out in the US, is part of the automaker’s strategy to get more people into EVs.\nNationally, though, public charging still has issues. Last month, the federal government paused a national program to build out a robust charging station network across the US. A recent survey from JD Power found that one in five of the EV drivers who visited public charging stations in the last three months of 2024 were unable to charge, due to station outages, long wait times, payment failures, and broken equipment. Vandalism has also been an issue; Tesla has confirmed it is testing a product called \"DyeDefender\" that sprays blue-staining dye on anyone who attempts to cut its charging cables.\nVehicle shoppers’ top three barriers to an EV purchase, the survey said, are charging-related: a lack of charging availability; the longer times required to charge up; and limited battery range. “If someone feels like the public charging infrastructure isn’t supportive enough, they might opt for an ICE vehicle,” says Brent Gruber, the head of the EV practice at JD Power, referring to internal combustion engines.\nFord’s attempt to solve these issues started in 2023. The Supercharger network has long been seen as one of Tesla’s great advantages, and drivers say the Tesla charger, now called the North American Charging Standard (NACS), is preferable because its connectors are lighter and easier to handle, and because the technology tends to work the first time it plugs in.\nSo Farley asked chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field—a former engineering head at Tesla—to ask the electric automaker about access to the Supercharger network. Tesla said no. Then Farley started a “complimentary” exchange with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on X, which turned into texting.\n“We eventually settled on something,” Farley says. Ford became the first non-Tesla automaker to announce that it would use NACS. The first Fords with built-in NACS connectors will come in 2026; for now, drivers will depend on their free adapters. (Replacements are $200 a pop.)\nFord's Supercharger adapter.\nWhen Ford said last year that its adapters would be free, the company was initially surprised by the customer enthusiasm for the product. Tesla was set to manufacture the Ford NACS adapters. But by mid-summer, Ford customers were flooding online forums with complaints of adapter delays, and Ford decided Tesla wasn’t quite moving fast enough, especially given the number needed.\n“We have a certain amount of patience, but given that this is something we promised our customers, we don't have unlimited patience,” Farley says. So Ford switched to Lectron, which manufactures EV chargers and adapters.\nNACS is open source, but officials with Lectron and Ford said the companies still had plenty of quick work to do to make sure that the Ford-branded adapter could survive in the real world. The companies tested the adapter in extreme cold and heat. Ford assumed its customers would beat up the thing—dropping it, slamming it, accidentally rolling over it with their EVs, which can weigh nearly 7,000 pounds—and it tested the adapter to make sure it could survive. The team decided at one point that the adapter’s latch wasn’t up to snuff, so transitioned it from zinc alloy to stainless steel.\nOne special manufacturing challenge was proofing the adapter against water, says Christopher Maiwald, the founder and CEO of Lectron. The firm wanted the adapter to survive for up to 30 minutes in more than 3 feet of water, but also to survive more than 10,000 insertions. “We learned a lot about sealing implementation,” says Maiwald. The whole thing was hard work. “It seems really quite mundane, but once you go into the details and understand how much learning and a little bit of suffering went into this, it’s really quite beautiful,” he says.\nIn October, Ford advised a number of customers to stop using their adapters; the affected products were manufactured by Tesla, Maiwald says. Ford confirmed Lectron wasn't responsible for the issue, but declined to specify Tesla's role. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nIndeed, the T-word looms large over not just this adapter project but the entire electric vehicle industry. In the US, protesters dismayed by CEO Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration have gathered outside Tesla showrooms, service centers, and charging stations. (Now that at least eight automakers’ vehicles have access to the Tesla charging network, the protests could make more than Tesla drivers uncomfortable.) Tesla sales have fallen off a cliff in Europe, thanks in part to Musk’s reputation and the new dominance of Chinese EV automakers. Sales have also fallen in the US, though not as dramatically.\nFarley calls Ford a “hungry” number two in US EV sales, but he mostly demurs when asked whether Tesla’s new role in politics might lead to changes on the EV leaderboard. “I've seen many, many companies have crises of reputation, but their consumer products are separated from their reputation, and they and customers are willing to separate the two,” he says.\n“What I've learned over time is that the company should be really focused on what it can control,” says Farley. He’s talking, in part, about his company's incoming lineup of affordable EVs, due out in 2027, to compete with already announced offerings from the likes of VW, Kia and Hyundai. Whether the charging network, accessed via a Tesla adaptor or not, is there to tempt consumers to convert in sufficient quantities remains to be seen.\nIn your inbox: Get Plaintext—Steven Levy's long view on tech\nMusk takeover: No, 150-year-olds aren’t collecting benefits\nBig Story: Are you lonely?

            "full_content": "No, you're not dreaming. In remarkable scenes outside the White House, the president of the United States has just gone and paid the better part of $100,000 for a car he's not yet driven, and which during the course of its production has been the subject of dozens of recalls for issues as diverse as seat-belt warning system malfunctions and unexpected speeding and lane changes.\nTesla sales may be down in the US, and in free fall in Europe right now, but Elon Musk will be hoping this will all change now that President Trump has personally bought one of his EVs.\nAfter turning the White House South Lawn into a Tesla showroom yesterday (minus any bothersome sidewalk protesters with “Swastikar” placards, naturally), President Trump got to look over models including the Model Y and a Cybertruck. But after due consideration, the president's seal of approval fell upon a 200-mph Model S Plaid in ultra red, with 1,020 horsepower, that can rocket from zero to 60 in 1.99 seconds.\n“Plaid” models are Tesla's high-performance versions of its EVs, complete with tri-motor systems and remarkable acceleration to match. It's a strange moniker, especially when you learn its origin: Elon Musk is apparently a huge fan of Spaceballs, where “Ludicrous Speed” is faster-than-light travel. When a ship hits this velocity in the film, a plaid-patterned tunnel appears in space.\nThe president's speaking notes from Tuesday’s event at the White House.\nClearly impressed as he stepped into the EV, President Trump gave a singular review of the Model S Plaid: “Wow, that's beautiful ... Everything's computer!” It certainly is, Mr. President. A Model S has approximately 10 teraflops of computing power, comparable to a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X.\nLikely referring to the significant negative coverage of Musk's efforts leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the president committed to buying a Tesla via TruthSocial on Tuesday morning, stating that Musk “was ‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! … I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk.”\nTurning to the Cybertruck at the White House Tesla walk-around, the president proclaimed that the 3.3-ton EV was “the coolest design.” But considering how the truck is apparently prone to rust, and the fact that its multiple recalls have ranked it worse than 91 percent of all 2024 vehicles, it is perhaps wise that President Trump opted for the Model S.\nThat said, the president's choice has sadly had more than its fair share of problems. The Model S has had 37 NHTSA safety recalls so far over the course of its existence, most recently in January for an issue where certain models of the tech-laden S's “computer circuit board may short, resulting in the loss of the rearview camera image,” increasing the risk of a crash.\nOther Model S recalls have included issues with airbags, potential problems with the power-steering assist feature, faulty door handles, warped brake discs, and in 2023 a voluntary recall for every one of Tesla's vehicles using the Full Self-Driving feature. According to NHTSA’s filing at the time, the issues included not properly stopping at a stop sign; speeding, due to failing to detect a road sign or because the driver has set their car to default to a faster speed; and making unexpected lane changes to move out of turn-only lanes when going straight through an intersection.\nIt should be noted, however, that due to the increasing complexity of the cars being made today, automotive recalls for numerous brands have surged in recent years, including Mercedes, General Motors, BMW, Chrysler, and Ford.\nMusk will be hoping that such a thumping presidential endorsement will reverse a worrying recent sales decline for the auto brand. According to Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold 43,650 EVs in February, a decrease of nearly 6 percent from the 46,262 sold in the same month last year. Globally, sales drops are much worse, with falls of more than 75 percent in Europe and 65 percent in Australia for the first two months of the year. The UK is one of the few markets bucking this trend, with Tesla's February sales up 20 percent compared with the same month last year.\nFor some customers already part of the Tesla collective, the shame of being associated with a brand's CEO who has made Nazi-like salutes and endorsed the far-right political party Alternative for Germany is proving too much, and they are rebadging their EVs with rival marque insignias.\nIn your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining stories\nDOGE takeover: Elon Musk’s toxicity could spell disaster for Tesla\nBig Story: A crypto crimefighter’s descent into Nigerian prison\nI dated multiple AI partners at once.

            "full_content": "by  Andrew J. Hawkins\nAmerica’s favorite low poly electric truck is facing a new set of problems that don’t have anything to do with people spray painting swastikas or crude comments about Elon Musk on them. Deliveries of the Tesla Cybertruck are on hold while the company addresses issues with reports that the trim is becoming detached and flying off, Electrek reports.\nTesla service representatives are telling customers awaiting deliveries that there is a “containment hold” on their trucks, according to several posts in the Cybertruck Owners Forum, as noted by Electrek. The customers are not being told it has anything to do with the vehicle’s trim, though. A containment hold is a proactive measure taken by automakers to address a quality issue or defect with a vehicle before it reaches customers.\nElectrek also shared a screenshot of direct messages between a customer and a Tesla service rep that mentioned an issue with the truck’s cantrail, or the decorative trim that covers the roof ledge above the door. The delay could take several weeks to address, depending on the severity of the loose trim.\nThe problem is likely related to a handful complaints filed with the federal government earlier this year, which noted that the trim above the truck’s windows appeared to be attached by glue.\nA video on YouTube posted over a month ago goes into greater detail about the issues with the cantrail trim.\nThis isn’t the first time we’re hearing about problems with the Cybertruck trim. Tesla issued a recall for over 11,000 trucks last summer for “improperly adhered… trunk bed trim sail applique.”\nThe Cybertruck has been recalled seven times since its official launch December 2023. Tesla sold an estimated 40,000 trucks in 2024, despite over 1 million reservations. There were anecdotal reports of Cybertrucks piling up on used car lots. Tesla Cybertruck factory workers in Austin were told to stay home for three days in December. And since Elon Musk’s elevation as a special advisor to the Trump administration, the Cybertruck has become a target of graffitti and vandalism from people opposed to Musk’s takeover of the federal government.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "A key federal watchdog is being stripped of its power to oversee potential fraud and abuse in online payment platforms just as Elon Musk’s site, X, attempts to become one.\nLate last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauâwhich is tasked with rooting out financial malfeasanceâissued a rule that expanded its purview to include digital payment apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle. Just as the CFPB is responsible for overseeing traditional financial institutions, the agency had also sought to exert oversight over the increasingly popular peer-to-peer payment sites. “Digital payments have gone from novelty to necessity and our oversight must reflect this reality,” the CFPB’s then-director Rohit Chopra said. “The rule will help to protect consumer privacy, guard against fraud, and prevent illegal account closures.”\nSince then, Trump has fired Chopra, and, amidst a broader rampage throughout the federal government, Musk’s DOGE has sought to shut down the CFPB. âRIP CFPB,â Musk posted in February, after having ransacked the agency. That same month, the newly installed CFPB chief, Russell Vought, enacted several policies that slowed the agencyâs operations to a crawl before telling all of the agencyâs staff members that they did not need to come in to work.\nThe attack on CFPB has since run into legal roadblocks, but the effort to destroy the agency comes at an interesting juncture, given that Musk’s platform, X, recently entered into an arrangement with Visa to create a peer-to-peer digital payments system. The new feature, which is still in the works, would allow the site’s users to transfer money and make payments in a Venmo-like fashion.\nNow, Republican lawmakers have sought to cut off the CFPB from monitoring such online payments. On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate voted on a resolution that would roll back the previously introduced CFPB rule that gave it the power to monitor online payment platforms. The resolution still needs to be approved by the House, but the House is also currently controlled by Republicans.\nCongressional acquiescence to policies that would benefit Musk’s companies is particularly worrying, given the fact that Musk has threatened to use his gargantuan fortune to “primary” (or, rather, unseat) any lawmaker that does not go along with his and President Trump’s agenda. Given the immense power and influence Musk has over the current administration, it’s also exceedingly difficult to disentangle what is Trump’s agenda and what is Musk’s agenda.\nThe Verge reports that a number of Democrats have attempted to push back on the GOP-led gutting of the CFPB. On Wednesday, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), and Senator Adam Schiff (D-California) wrote to Doug Collins, the Acting Director of the Office of Government Ethics, demanding to know whether the conflicts of interest inherent to Musk’s role in government were being probed.\nâNotably, the CFPB has taken steps in recent years to protect consumers from fraud on digital payment apps and collects proprietary information from the digital payment industry,â Warren and Schiff wrote. âMr. Musk is also the founder and CEO of Tesla, which offers customers the option of working with Tesla to finance their auto purchases. The CFPB plays a critical role in supervising the auto lending industry and protecting consumers from corporate malfeasance and scams. Therefore, actions by Mr. Musk and DOGE at the CFPB have the potential to directly benefit X, Visa, and Teslaâand by extension, Mr. Musk.â\nWeirdly enough, the effort to destroy CFPB has also inspired outrage across the aisle, specifically from rightwing influencer Laura Loomer. Loomer, who is best known for spouting conspiracy theories online, recently took to social media to bash the GOP’s attack on the regulatory agency which, she correctly pointed out, is responsible for stopping “debanking”âthe supposedly discriminatory phenomenon in which a financial institution can decide to blacklist certain individuals or businesses. The crypto community, in particular, has claimed that “debanking” is a huge problem for them. “Every Senate Republican with the exception of Senator Josh Hawley @HawleyMO just voted to LEGALIZE DEBANKING,” Loomer recently wrote on X. “Now apps like PayPal can get away with banning you for your political views thanks to Senate Republicans who just voted to repeal a rule that made that illegal in Dec 2024.”\nDonald Trump’s First Buddy Elon Musk replied to Loomer with a single word: “Really?”\n\nDonald TrumpElon MuskLaura LoomerX (Twitter) \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

At the livestreamed meeting, Musk told employees to “hang on to your stock” – which declined in value by 50 percent since December – and promised big things are coming for its Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot.\nMusk deflected on the stock drop at the meeting and reiterated promises that Tesla’s autonomous software used for its vehicles’ so-called Full Self-Driving feature, robotaxis, and Optimus bots would bring the company’s value to new heights. “It’s so profound and there’s no comparison with anything in the past,” Musk said. He says they can make about 5,000 Optimus robots this year. “I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,” Musk said.\nOn the Cybercab, Musk said a “revolutionary manufacturing process” is in the works that can build a robotaxi in “less than five seconds” like “a high-speed consumer electronics line.” Musk said Tesla will need to make a very big casting machine, which sounds like the “gigacasting” process the company was working on but reportedly pulled back on last year. Tesla revealed the Cybercab at its “We, Robot” event last year, and Musk said people could buy one for $30,000 by 2026.\nThese all-hand-on meetings usually happen during the day, but Musk seems pressured by escalating protests and concerned analysts, like Wedbush’s Dan Ives, who expressed concerns about how much time Musk spends on politics. “I have, like, 17 jobs,” Musk told the employee audience. During the Q and A portion of the meeting, employees did not bring up Musk’s role in Washington actively backing the Trump administration.\nMusk has been spending a good deal of time heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) promising to cut wasteful government spending, but instead, recklessly gutting crucial institutions such as the FTC and USAID. In addition, he runs SpaceX, Neurallink, and The Boring Company.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Tesla has fired a manager after he wrote a LinkedIn post criticizing Elon Musk’s jokes about Nazis, according to a report from the New York Times. And it’s a great reminder that not only is Musk currently destroying the U.S. government through massive cuts that will change America’s way of life for generations to come, he’s still making time to be a vindictive prick to workers at the half dozen companies he currently controls, like Tesla, X, and SpaceX.\nThe fired Tesla manager, identified as Jared Ottmann, worked with the electric vehicle company’s battery suppliers, according to the Times. And Ottmann didn’t appreciate the jokes that Musk made after the billionaire gave two Nazi-style salutes the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20.\n“Donât say Hess to Nazi accusations! Some people will Goebbels anything down!” Musk wrote on Jan. 23. “Stop GÅring your enemies! His pronouns wouldâve been He/Himmler! Bet you did nazi that coming.”\nGoebbels, Goring, and Himmler were all Nazis, instrumental in their own ways for the deaths of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. And many people saw Musk’s jokes as in poor taste, especially after the salutes he gave just a few days earlier.\nOttmann expressed his disapproval of Musk’s jokes on LinkedIn, sharing a screenshot of Musk’s tweet and writing, “Well, we have seen it coming. Elonâs behavior, whatever the underlying motivations, are well documented.”\nOttmann went on to explain that he’d raised “the issue” with Musk internally multiple times since 2022, including with managers, HR, legal compliance, and investor relations. It’s not immediately clear what Ottmann is referring to regarding “the issue” but Musk has been accused repeatedly of racist and antisemitic behavior.\nOne of the most galling incidents known publicly was in Nov. 2023 when Musk agreed with an extremist account that was floating a conspiracy theory about Jewish people. Musk replied with “You have said the actual truth.”\nOttmann wrote in his LinkedIn post that “Tesla as a company has remained silent” and that Musk’s post of Nazi jokes “name drops genocidal assholes as a joke and has 308,000 likes.” The post has over 55 million views at the time of this writing.\n“The silence from Tesla is deafening. Whatâs a mensch to do?” Ottmann concluded.\nAs the Times notes, Musk doesn’t tolerate dissent of any kind at his companies, despite often calling himself a free speech absolutist. Nine employees of SpaceX were fired in 2022 after the billionaire made jokes about the sexual harassment complaint against him. The employees wanted SpaceX to distance itself from the company founder, but they found themselves without a job.\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back, but we’re not going to hold our breath. Musk dissolved Tesla’s PR office in 2020. The billionaire says he prefers to speak directly with the people on his platform X, which seems true. Especially if speaking to the people directly involves some jokes about Nazis.\n\nDonald TrumpElon MuskTESLAX (Twitter) \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Teslas are getting more expensive to insure thanks to the manufacturerâs sliding fortunes and reports of vandalism against the cars. There are few markets as pure, heartless, and single-minded as auto insurance. Itâs a machine run on actuarial tables and its calculations are telling insurers that theyâll probably have to pay out a damage claim if they cover a Tesla EV.\nTech billionaire and shadow president Elon Muskâs personal brand and fortune are linked to the cars. They are a visible reminder to people everyday that Musk is tearing through the federal government and destroying things with no oversight or regard for the human cost of the damage he inflicts. Itâs pissed people off and theyâre taking it out on Tesla.\nProtestors are standing outside Tesla lots and waving anti-Musk signs. Celebrities and influencers are going viral with videos announcing the sell-off of their Musk-branded EV. People are throwing molotov cocktails at Teslas, spray painting them with swastikas, stealing their tires, and setting them on fire. During a Mardis Gras parade earlier this month, revelers repeatedly pelted a Cybertruck with beads, bottles, and other debris for three hours as it weaved its way through the parade route.\nAs the news, and insurance claims, pile up, insurers are driving up rates. âModel X or S Plaid drivers pay much higher average rates. Comparatively, average BMW i4 insurance costs are closer to that of a Model 3, at $3,792 per year for full coverage,â Shannon Martin, a Bankrate insurance analyst, told Newsweek. âTesla Model 3, Model Y, and Model X are the most expensive EV to insure as of February 2025.â\nThe cost to insure a Tesla Model 3 went up 30 percent last year. âThis is 25 percent higher in cost than the comparable Mercedes Benz A-Class,â Martin said. Itâs possible those numbers will continue to climb.\nThis has happened before. In 2023, Kia and Hyundai cheaped out when they manufactured some of their cars. As a result, some of their cars became easy to steal using a USB charging cable. It fueled a social media trend where people would steal the cars, joyride them, and post a video about it on TikTok. Insurance rates for the vehicles skyrocketed and owners filed class action lawsuits against the manufacturer.\nSomeone has also launched a website called âDOGEQUESTâ that allegedly shows the location of Tesla superchargers, dealerships, and Tesla owners. The website shows a map of the United States and users navigate it with a cursor shaped like a Molotov cocktail. Clicking individual cars gives you personal information about alleged Tesla owners. Some of the info included their name, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and employment information.\n404 Media first reported on DOGEQUEST and was able to verify that some, but not all, of the information on it is accurate. âThe veracity of much of the data is unclear. 404 Media has verified that at least some of the people listed on the site do appear to be Tesla owners or supporters of the company or Musk, but it is not clear if every person listed is,â 404 Media said in its report. âThe addresses of several Tesla dealerships checked by 404 Media were correct. 404 Media found some plots on the map donât correspond correctly to their real-world locations.â\nThe website bills itself as a place that connects âlike-minded Tesla owners with one another, facilitating a vibrant community through shared contact information.â âIs DOGEQUEST a protest platform?â It asks itself. âIf you’re on the hunt for a Tesla to unleash your artistic flair with a spray can, just step outsideâno map needed! At DOGEQUEST, we believe in empowering creative expressions of protest that you can execute from the comfort of your own home. DOGEQUEST neither endorses nor condemns any actions.â\nThe site also claims that it will remove peopleâs personal information from the site if they send in a specific kind of request. âJust provide us with proof that you’ve sold your Teslaâ¦we only accept scanned documents in JPG and PNG formats.â\n\nDOGEElectric VehiclesElon MuskInsuranceTESLA \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The nation's space agency is cutting costs at the behest of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as part of the Trump administration's slashing of science funding.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \n\n          The FBI has asked the public to \"look out for suspicious activity in areas occupied by Tesla dealerships.\"\n        \n\n          The bans follow demonstrations protesting the arrest of ErdoÄan's main political rival.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

That would be Siri, which Apple said last year it had turned from a quasi-helpful voice assistant into an AI-powered helper that could understand everything about you and accomplish things on your behalf. Sounds cool, right? It was one of the flagship features of the iPhone 16 lineup, a big part of the way Apple promoted its new devices. Except it doesn’t exist. And it won’t anytime soon.\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, we talk about exactly where things went wrong with Siri — and with the whole gadget industry, which became so enraptured with the promise of AI that it sort of forgot to make good gadgets. Nilay and David discuss the problems and promise with Alexa, the still-enticing ideas behind “ambient computing,” and what it’ll take for Apple to make things right.

Tesla’s rise has in so many ways enabled Musk’s own, and it appears man and company are more closely tied than ever. That might be a problem for the car company.\nFinally, in the lightning round, Nilay and David discuss the end of Sonos’s set-top box dreams, some big news in the Home Assistant world, Brendan Carr’s latest regulatory absurdities, what’s next for Pokémon Go, TikTok’s new tool for teens, and Bluesky CEO Jay Graber’s epic sartorial shitpost.\nIf you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with Apple:\nAnd in the lightning round:\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Where do Elon Musk’s business interests end and Donald Trump’s political interests begin? Trick question—they’re one and the same.\nHow else do you explain the jarring sight of the President of the United States hawking Teslas on the White House South Lawn? Trump has always been a salesman, lending his name to real estate, casinos, restaurants, steaks, vitamins, a fragrance for men, watches, water, a bicycle race, office chairs, sneakers, vodka, coins, another fragrance, NFTs. You could, at this very moment, buy a Trump pickleball paddle from the Trump Store online, or a Trump sea mist & sage candle.\nBut Trump is most famously a pitchman for himself. (And Pizza Hut, if the price is right.) To spend this much political capital on Musk? The world’s richest man? Over a few protests at Tesla dealerships and a tanking stock price? Come on.\nTrump is no altruist. Musk did, though, spend nearly $300 million on the 2024 US election cycle, with the vast majority of that directly in support of Trump’s presidential campaign. His transformation of Twitter into X has created an online MAGAtopia barely rivaled by Trump’s own Truth Social platform. And his work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has let Trump outsource the tedious mechanics of actual governance.\nTrump reading off a literal list of Tesla retail prices is the purest distillation yet of a dynamic that won’t end well. It’s already going quite badly, for them and for us: The stock market is tanking, Musk is nearing rock bottom in opinion polls. GOP representatives are canceling town hall meetings rather than face the wrath of constituents over DOGE. Trump’s own cabinet officials are apparently just as fed up with Musk’s level of influence.\nMeanwhile, that influence continues to grow. When engineers from SpaceX invaded the Federal Aviation Administration, they reportedly were quick to suggest their own Starlink technology as the solution to the agency’s technical problems. On Thursday, a month after Musk inexplicably met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Washington, DC—with three of Musk’s children in tow—Starlink inked deals this week with two major wireless carriers there, creating a glide path for operating in the country.\nEven Congress, supposedly a coequal branch of government, is beholden to Musk’s tempers and tweets. At a talk at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson named Trump and Musk as the two people he prioritizes.\n“Elon has the largest platform in the world, literally,” Johnson said. “If he goes on and says something that's misunderstood or misinterpreted about something we're doing, he can blow the whole thing up.”\nWhat started as a self-serving bromance has become more volatile, and it goes deeper than DOGE. Trump told a reporter during his infomercial on Tuesday that he would label anyone who committed violence against Tesla dealerships a “domestic terrorist.” On Wednesday, members of the House DOGE subcommittee sent a letter to Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel and US attorney general Pam Bondi to probe the “wave of organized attacks” in recent weeks against Musk and Tesla.\nRather than process the “Tesla Takedown” protests as a sign of the deep unpopularity of DOGE and its ringleader, Trump and his adherents have leaned into conflation. What’s good for society is what’s good for Elon Musk. What’s bad for Elon Musk must be bad for society.\nThe lines are too blurred and the stakes too high. When Elon Musk calls the foreign minister of Poland a “small man,” will that animus be reflected in US policy? When he tells members of Congress to call him with concerns about DOGE, will they be speaking with a special adviser to the president or the guy who holds billions of dollars in government contracts? Whose interests does it serve when Musk blames a denial-of-service attack against X on Ukraine, even though there’s no indication that the country was involved?\nIt’s hard to overstate how deeply weird it is to see Trump, who never met a self-promotion he didn’t like, promote someone else. Even weirder when that person is increasingly a liability. In previous administrations, Musk’s deep unpopularity would have made him exactly the kind of person Trump fired unceremoniously, with an offhand I barely knew the guy. But Elon Musk is no Anthony Scaramucci. He’s not even a Corey Lewandowski. He’s the world’s richest man, and by god he needs to sell some cars.\nThere may be signs that this fever is breaking. Musk reportedly has designs on donating $100 million to Trump-affiliated political action committees; The Financial Times says that Musk was rebuffed and is wearing out his welcome. Musk wanted a government shutdown; Trump has pushed aggressively to prevent one.\nBut whatever rifts may exist between Trump and Musk aren’t wide enough to stop the president from dropping at least $90,000 on a cherry-red Tesla Model S Plaid. To save him from saying “everything’s computer!” in front of press pool cameras when confronted with a modern dashboard. To give Musk a vote of confidence so over-the-top that it simultaneously debases himself and his office.\nTesla stock had a nice bounce, though.\nHow long will Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s close relationship last?\nLeave a comment on the site or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWant more?

But when will we see it in the US?\nThe sporty hatchback will sell for €20,000 when it launches in Europe in 2027. But when will we see it in the US?\nby  Andrew J. Hawkins\nVolkswagen is bringing up the lights on the ID. EVERY1 show car that it says will become the promised €20,000 (about $20,800 USD) affordable EV that will hopefully turn around the automaker’s struggling business. \nAs market leaders like Tesla continue to promise — but not deliver — the elusive entry-level EV, VW is hoping to shake things up with the unveiling of plans for a whole lineup of mass-market vehicles. The car will also be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs. But whether it makes it to North America, with all the uncertainty around EV policy right now, remains unknown. \nThe car will be a crucial competitor as VW hopes to fend off a tidal wave of affordable Chinese EVs\nThe ID. EVERY1 will slot below the ID. 2all, which was first unveiled in 2023 with the promised price of €25,000. Both vehicles are only slated for Europe for now, with production expected to begin in 2026 for the ID. 2all and 2027 for the ID. EVERY1. (It seems likely those names could change, too, when we actually get closer to production.)\nThe ID. EVERY1 is a small hatchback with new software and some neat tricks like a modular center console — characteristics it will share with the ID. 2all. Both models are part of the new “Electric Urban Car Family” based on front-wheel drive versions of VW’s modular electric platform. These new EVs are being developed under the umbrella of the Core brand group within the Volkswagen Group, the company said. In total, the automaker expects to unveil nine new models by 2027.\nThe production versions of the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all will be built on the second-generation version of VW’s modular “MEB” platform. The current version of MEB powers the ID.4 crossover SUV, the ID Buzz minivan, and a dozen other vehicles from Audi, Skoda, and others. \nOf course, for that price, you can’t expect much in the realm of performance or range. VW says the concept ID. EVERY1 tops out at 81mph and is powered by a newly developed electric motor with 94 horsepower (70kW). VW didn’t disclose the battery size, but based on the estimated 155 miles (250km) of range, we can assume it’s somewhere around 35kWh. \nThe ID. EVERY1 won’t take up much room, at 152.8 inches in length, or around 27 inches shorter than the VW ID.4. Still, the hatchback can fit up to four passengers, with 10.8 cubic feet of storage in the trunk. \nVW says the production version of the ID. EVERY1 will be the company’s first vehicle to feature a new “powerful” software architecture that promises over-the-air updates. (Software has proven to be a bit of a pain for VW, with bugs and infrequent updates plaguing its ID family of vehicles for years.) \nDesign-wise, the ID. EVERY1 looks chunky and fairly adorable, with cues from small SUVs as well as VW’s discontinued Up and Polo minicars, while also retaining stylings from the ID. Life concept from 2021. VW says the new design language that infuses the ID. EVERY1 and ID. 2all emphasizes minimalism, likability, and a “secret sauce” like the “flying roof concept,” in which the roof surface is lower in the middle without restricting headroom on the inside. \nVW is also bringing some of the modular designs from the ID Buzz to the low-cost segment. The center console can be transferred to the rear of the vehicle, and the dash features a rail on which various accessories can be affixed, including a tablet, shelf, or table. There’s also a small illuminated and removable Bluetooth speaker between the driver and front passenger, reminiscent of Rivian’s R1 vehicles.\nEV prices aren’t the only place Volkswagen is trying to cut costs. Following a labor strike in Germany, it reached a union deal that will mean 35,000 fewer workers and billions per year in cost cutting.\nOther automakers are increasingly piling into the affordable EV space. As competition from China heats up, Hyundai and Kia are both promising more low-cost models. Tesla swears it will have a lower-priced EV to reveal sometime this year. And even Ford says it plans on releasing its own entry-level EVs — just as soon as it figures out how to make them profitable.\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk has spent the past month destroying the U.S. federal government with his team of DOGE goons, taking a chainsaw to USAID, NOAA, Social Security, and countless other vital agencies. And while President Donald Trump is ostensibly the guy in charge of the country, most Americans understand Musk has the real power. And there’s a growing movement to protest the billionaire CEO at Tesla dealerships and SpaceX headquarters.\nThe grassroots protest movement 50501 launched a website earlier this month to let people find the demonstrations against Trump and his cronies. But if you’re looking for protests that specifically target Musk, the website Tesla Takedown is the place to be.\nThe Tesla Takedown website is searchable by zip code. For example, typing in a Los Angeles zip code right now delivers the results below for events in L.A. proper down to Long Beach and even as far away as Irvine in Orange County, California. The protests listed when you search an L.A. zip code are all at Tesla dealerships and Tesla storefronts across Southern California on Saturday, March 1, as well as Sunday, March 2. But obviously, you can search for any zip code in the entire country.\nTesla Takedown was started by activist BostonJoan on Bluesky and the website was created by Alex Winter, an actor and activist, along with his production company Trouper, which has made similar call-to-action websites for various documentaries. Winter told Gizmodo over email Friday that a website like his allows for something that’s very decentralized, like the anti-Musk protests, to have a central hub for people to find information.\n“This one worked far better than we imagined,” Winter wrote about the website. “In the short time itâs been up, weâve had over 45,000 unique visitors who are spending real time on the site to read the information. Itâs very encouraging.”\nWinter says there are three goals with Tesla Takedown protests, sparked by Musk’s destruction of the country.\n“First, to drive down the value of Tesla cars and Tesla stock, to force a shareholder vote of no-confidence in Musk, and to remove him from the company,” wrote Winter. “Second, to provide a simple and effective means of protest for the millions of angry citizens who don’t accept Muskâs illegal and destructive intrusion into the US government. And third, to create a means to disseminate information on Musk and DOGE’s criminal activities and help educate and inform the public.”\nIt should be noted that not every anti-Musk protest is going to be listed on Tesla Takedown. But that’s the nature of a massive movement against a guy with such diversified interests. For instance, there’s a protest at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California, on Saturday that doesn’t appear on the Tesla Takedown website. Musk is the leader of half a dozen companies.\nMusk has never been confirmed as a formal member of the government but has been appointed by Trump to oversee DOGE, which has gained access to federal agencies with the stated goal of shaving $2 trillion from the federal budget. That means thousands of people are now losing their jobs as the Department of Justice argues Musk isn’t even the administrator of DOGE right now. This is despite Musk essentially running cabinet meetings while suggesting that he alone gets to decide what gets funded in the government.\nCongress is actually in charge of deciding what gets funded, but with Republicans in control of both the House and the Senate, they have no desire to stop Musk’s wrecking ball act. All of that leaves regular people on the street wondering what they can do to express their displeasure with Musk, since their elected representatives are doing nothing. One small way to do something, as some see it, is to show up at a protest against Musk.\n“There is a growing movement to divest, Tesla stock is in a precipitous decline,” Winter told Gizmodo. “So weâre feeling bullish. Not cocky by any means, but hopeful that regular citizens can make a difference.”\n\nDOGEDonald TrumpElon Musk \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          The nation's space agency is cutting costs at the behest of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as part of the Trump administration's slashing of science funding.\n        \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go – because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. \nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. \nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. \nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February – although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% – as well as in Australia. \nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day – adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y – with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada – although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes – significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake – currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings – a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles – which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers – or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment –  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

            "full_content": "Politicians are pressing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to answer questions about a government contract for armored Teslas that never existed. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-NY) and Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-NY) both sent letters to Rubio last week with a detailed list of questions they want the Secretary to answer.\nThe letters concern a Biden-era State Department contract for armored Teslas that, if fulfilled, would have enriched the Elon Musk-owned company to the tune of $400 million. âThe decision to consider purchasing Tesla vehicles for this purpose highlights the obvious conflicts of interest inherent in Mr. Muskâs dual roles as the Chief Executive Officer of Tesla, Inc. and the practical head of the Department of Government Efficiency,â Blumenthalsâs letter said.\nBlumenthal is a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the chairman of its Investigations subcommittee. His letter is dated March 3 and heâs demanding answers from Rubio by today.\nMeeks is a ranking member of the Houseâs Committee on Foreign Affairs. He sent his letter on March 7 and is demanding his answers no later than March 14. âWe write to you to request answers and documentation to respond to a series of media reports that the Department of State and Elon Musk intended to engage in unlawful procurement activities that would constitute a serious violation of federal procurement laws, and in doing so planned to unlawfully enrich Mr. Musk,â Meeks said in his letter.\nThe saga of the armored Teslas began last month when Drop Site News uncovered a line item in a procurement forecast that called for spending $400 million on armoring Teslas. This document is not a budget, itâs a forecast put together by State that talks about money they might spend in the future.\nWhen D.C. decides to spend money, it can take a long time. First, it puts out a Request for Information (RFI), a signal to contractors about what it wants. Then, it looks through the RFIs and, after a lengthy decision-making process, decides whether to spend the money. Thereâs a 2024 RFI about armoring electric vehicles here.\nWhen I talked to the State Department about this story, they told me that the use of the word âTeslaâ had been a clerical error and said that it was a Biden-era initiative that wasnât moving forward. Theyâd put out the RFI, they said, and only got one response back.\nSomeone at State also went back to the original procurement document and changed the word âTeslaâ to âelectric vehicle.â In the journalism business, we call this a âstealth edit,â and it tends to make you look guilty.\nThe armored Teslas saga continued to blow up. At the end of February, NPR reported that it had documents that undercut Stateâs denials. NPR didnât share these documents or directly quote them. According to its reporting, Bidenâs State Department planned to spend about $483,000 in 2025 buying âlight-duty EVs.â $483,000 is not $400 million. It is considerably less than that. NPR also didnât say that the electric vehicles referenced in the documents would be Teslas.\nBlumenthal’s letter to Rubio assumes that State is buying Teslas, though, and that itâs going all in on Cybertrucks. âThis concern was exacerbated by the fact that the vehicle in question was a Tesla Cybertruck, a failed experiment of a car which has been subject to numerous recalls since its announcement, and would not reasonably be considered for this purpose absent a heavy thumb on the scale,â Blumenthal said.\nNPRâs story featured several experts who have conflicting opinions about the viability of up-armored Cybertrucks as State Department vehicles. Some say itâs the perfect vehicle, others say it would be terrible. But, as best I can tell, no contract for the purchase of Cybertrucks exists or has ever existed. NPR doesnât claim that the State Department plans to spend money on Cybertrucks, just that it could.\nI spent the morning crawling through the public database of government contracts. The State Department has spent the last few years buying electric vehicles. Some of them are Teslas. The total cost of the Teslas marked as âlight dutyâ by State in 2024 is around $500,000. Most of the individual contracts are for Model Ys and will be used in South East Asia.\nBlumenthal’s letter spends a lot of time decrying Stateâs use of Cybertrucks, something that was probably never planned. Meeks, however, spends more time on what I think is the real scandal here: stealth editing the forecast document.\nâScreenshots published by NPR in its February 24 reporting showed that in the two weeks since Drop Site first published news of the procurement of Armored Tesla vehicles, the Department had quietly edited the procurement forecast documents to remove any specific mention of Tesla but did not immediately remove the project itself,â Meeks said. âThis suggests the Department may have intended to move forward with the project but obscure any involvement by Mr. Musk or Tesla.â\nAt the time, State told me that writing âTeslaâ in that space was a clerical error. It insisted it should have been a generic entry that read âelectric vehicle manufacturer.â On one hand, changing it makes them look guilty. On the other hand, the very real graft and corruption perpetrated by Musk and other Trump associates is out in the open. They are hardly trying to hide it.\nVerizon once had a contract to upgrade the communications systems of the Federal Aviation Administration worth around $2 billion. Musk suggested it wasnât up to the task and said that SpaceX, a company he owns, should do it instead. Thatâs happening. Musk and his companies were facing several investigations and pending regulations related to Neuralink, X, and SpaceX. Using DOGE, heâs decimated the agencies in charge of many of those investigations.\nMusk has celebrated these perceived wins publicly. He posts about them on X. Trump praised Starlink during an interview with Sean Hannity. Thereâs going to be a lot of corruption in the next four years, and a lot of it simply wonât be hidden.\nIf State ends up buying Teslas, Musk will post about how awesome itâs going to be for the government to drive his cars. Trump will announce the deal with fanfare and praise. Heâd come out and say he got a really good deal from Elon on electric vehicles. It wonât be hidden. Itâll be right in front of our faces.\n\nDonald TrumpElon MuskState DepartmentTeslas \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk is planning to give $100 million to two political groups associated with President Donald Trump, according to a report from the New York Times. The move is unprecedented in American politics for many reasons, including the fact that federal “employees” like Musk typically don’t give millions of dollars to their “boss.” But it’s also notable because Trump just hosted a wildly unethical promotional event for Tesla at the White House on Tuesday.\nMusk plans to donate a combined $100 million to the super PAC known as Make America Great Again Inc. and a political nonprofit group Securing American Greatness, according to the report from the Times. One thing that makes these donations so odd is that Musk already has his own group, known as America PAC, which was instrumental in running disinformation campaigns to help Trump win the election in November.\nWhy isn’t Musk just donating to his own PAC? That part isn’t clear. But the Times speculates it’s part of a desire for the billionaire to show he’s a “team player.” Musk and Trump don’t like each other very much on a personal level, according to countless insider gossip accounts over recent months. But they clearly have an understanding that they need each other to accomplish their goals. Musk wants control of the U.S. government in order to funnel money to his own businesses, and Trump needs Musk’s money to keep politicians in line.\nMusk, for example, bought ads targeting Sen. Joni Ernst in Iowa when it looked like the Republican might not support the confirmation of Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary. Hegseth had been accused of sexual assault and railed against the presence of women in the military, two issues that apparently upset Ernst. But after Musk ran the ads, Ernst fell in line, and Hegseth was confirmed, albeit with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\nAmerica PAC has now moved on to influencing the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, with Musk’s group dropping over $8 million to support a conservative judge in an election next month, according to the Associated Press. Donald Trump Jr. and Charlie Kirk are even swooping in to hold a town hall for the conservative judge on Monday.\nThe other very odd thing about Musk’s plan to spend money on groups for Trump is that it has no historical precedent in the U.S. political system. Musk is the wealthiest person in the world but also ostensibly an “employee” of the federal government. By giving money to Trump-affiliated groups, he appears to be buying even more influence than he already has. Musk is unilaterally shutting down payments to programs he doesn’t like and has dismantled USAID, an action that’s blatantly illegal since only Congress has the power to create and destroy agencies through appropriations. The Department of Education is being destroyed this week, and Musk has signaled that Social Security is next on the list.\nMusk’s actions are being challenged in the courts, but there are no guarantees that even if the good guys win, much of the damage will be fixable. Once you destroy enormous institutions, it’s not like flipping a light switch to bring them back. Leases have been canceled, and tens of thousands of people have been fired. If you wanted to remake USAID tomorrow, it would require enormous resources to get the agency back up and running.\nMany people are also suspicious of the timing of Musk’s donations, since Trump has been promoting Tesla in recent weeks, going so far as to hold an event Tuesday with Musk while standing in front of the electric carmaker’s vehicles. Trump said he was going to buy a Tesla, and news cameras even captured a sheet of paper that Trump was reading from, which looked identical to sales literature. Trump even posted a screenshot of a tweet from Fox News host Sean Hannity, who claimed he had recently purchased a Tesla.\nThis kind of salesmanship and self-dealing is obviously normalized at this point with Trump in office, but if you step back and remember what’s actually happening here, it’s truly bizarre. You have two billionaires standing outside the White House promoting their wares like it’s a used car lot. All because Tesla’s sales have plummeted and its stock price has tanked as Musk’s brand has become synonymous with fascism.\nThe U.S. is little more than a punchline around the world, but it’s an increasingly dangerous environment for vulnerable Americans. The trans community is under attack, children are getting food ripped from their mouths, and a green card holder was just thrown into ICE detention and faces deportation not for breaking the law but for saying things the government didn’t like.\nNobody knows what will happen in the near future, but the Democrats have put up very little resistance to the ongoing fascist takeover of the U.S. In fact, 17 Democrats voted to confirm Trump’s labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, this week. These people have the gall to say they’re doing everything they can to fight back against Musk and Trump, all while voting to install their hand-picked stooges.\nThe protests as Tesla dealerships are making waves, but if the Democrats don’t start acting like a real opposition party, there will be no real fix to America’s current predicament. And time is running out.\n\nDonald TrumpElon Muskoligarchy \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Elon Musk has some words for Tesla vandals.\nAsked about the widespread incidents against Tesla dealerships and vehicles during a \"Hannity\" on Fox News appearance on Tuesday, Musk denounced them and said the vandalism had reached levels he'd never seen.\nHe also attributed the incidents to those on the political left.\n\"It's really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left,\" Musk said.\nProtests have spread across the US since Musk began his work with the White House DOGE office in January. Across the pond, the slogan \"Don't buy a Tesla\" has been used as a rallying cry of sorts in places such as Berlin and Wales.\nThe grassroots \"Tesla Takedown\" protest movement, which started on Bluesky, a competitor to Musk's X platform, has called for Tesla owners to sell their vehicles and stock in an effort to \"stop Musk now.\" A website for the effort has listed dozens of public demonstrations at Tesla showrooms in recent weeks.\n\"I always thought that the left, you know, Democrats, were supposed to be the party of empathy, the party of caring, and yet they're burning down cars, they're firebombing dealerships, they're firing bullets into dealerships, they're smashing up Teslas,\" Musk said.\n\"Tesla is a peaceful company,\" he said. \"We've never done anything harmful.\"\nMusk also suggested, without evidence, that the protests and vandalism incidents might be part of a broader conspiracy against him.\n\"I mean, I don't know, who's funding it and who's coordinating it? Because this is crazy. I've never seen anything like this,\" Musk said.\nSince January, DOGE has worked to reduce government costs and what it describes as fraudulent spending and corruption. The effort has sent representatives to multiple federal government agencies and examined federal programs such as the Social Security Administration.\nThough he didn't mention a government department by name, Musk accused some people of receiving money \"fraudulently\" and suggested a possible connection to the protests against him and Tesla.\n\"And they basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we're stopping the terrible waste and corruption in the government,\" he told host Sean Hannity.\n\"I've never done anything harmful,\" he said.\nBoth President Donald Trump and the Justice Department have recently weighed in on the vandalism against Tesla, which the police say has included Tesla charging stations set on fire, gunfire damage at dealerships, and damage to Tesla vehicles.\nWhen asked earlier this month whether he was considering labeling violent attacks against Tesla dealerships as \"domestic terrorism,\" Trump indicated he would.\n\"They're bad guys. They're the same guys who screw around with our schools and universities,\" Trump said. \"We're going to catch you, and you're going to go through hell.\"\nThe Justice Department said Tuesday that it was pursuing those suspected of carrying out the ongoing vandalism, calling it \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\"\nMusk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\nThe police are investigating attacks in their areas in partnership with federal agencies, and arrests have been made in some cases.\nIn February, a Colorado woman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in a vandalism incident and charged with criminal intent to commit a felony, criminal mischief, and using explosives or incendiary devices during a felony, police records say.\nSome Tesla owners have meanwhile told BI they have decided to sell their vehicles amid the protests or have affixed bumper stickers saying \"I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.\"\nOwners of the Cybertruck, the vehicle most closely associated with Musk, also told BI they'd experienced an uptick in road rage and vandalism directed at them in recent months."

Elon's own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or US interests.\"\nThe ruling is the latest development in the ongoing tensions between Musk and Altman, who cofounded OpenAI in 2015. Musk left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction, later accusing OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission.\nLast month, Musk led a $97.4 billion bid to take control of OpenAI, which the company's board swiftly rejected.\nno thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want\n\"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,\" Musk's attorney, Marc Toberoff, said in a statement following the bid.\nAltman said in a February interview that he believed Musk's actions were an attempt to slow down OpenAI, which competes against Musk's xAI. \nRepresentatives for Musk did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment."

            "full_content": "Time is ticking for Tesla's promised lower-cost vehicle.\nThe electric car giant said in its most recent earnings call earlier this year that production for the long-awaited \"more affordable\" Tesla would begin in the first half of 2025.\nThat means Tesla has three and a half months to deliver.\nWith Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts tell BI the launch is \"crucial\" and a \"necessity.\"\nElon Musk has promised a cheaper EV for years. A sub-$30,000 model would likely drive sales for the automaker, which hasn't been immune to the impact of slowing EV adoption and pricing pressure from cheaper rivals like BYD in China.\nWith Tesla's stock sinking nearly 50% this year, wiping out its post-election gains, the company could use a boost. Deliveries fell in February in several markets outside the US.\nGetting a more attainable price tag in front of cash-strapped shoppers could be just what Tesla needs to reinvigorate sales.\n\"Against this backdrop, accelerating the launch of more affordable vehicles has become more than just a tailwind but, rather, a key necessity for the company,\" Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, told Business Insider. A cheaper model could also be an entry point into the Indian market, he said.\nWedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives told BI that the lower-cost EV is a \"crucial new model to drive mass demand for Tesla that is missing a catalyst today.\"\n\"There were many perceived headwinds for Musk and Tesla but it's all about new innovation and it starts this summer,\" Ives said.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said he spoke with the company a few weeks ago and heard that the plan is still to release the vehicle in the first half of 2025.\nNarayan said that it's also worth noting that Tesla expected to face some of the headwinds it's experiencing now.\nFor example, Tesla said that its Model Y refresh would lead to several weeks of lost production as assembly lines are overhauled and production ramps up. The Model 3 and Model Y are now becoming older models and increasingly appearing in the used car market, Narayan said, and consumers may also be delaying new purchases in anticipation of a newer, cheaper model.\nDespite ongoing protests against Musk and Tesla, Narayan doesn't consider them to be a major factor as many car buyers simply want to buy a great product — regardless of the CEO.\nMore important to the company is the slowing growth in the EV industry and greater competition in China, Investing.com's Monteiro said.\nWhile a lower-priced Tesla could boost car sales, Narayan said it might not completely reverse the stock downturn, adding that it's normal for the stock to fluctuate after a \"huge run.\" He said the vehicle's design, and whether it launches on schedule will be key factors to watch.\nMonteiro said that Tesla's \"next growth cycle may not be in cheaper models,\" but in the next \"groundbreaking technological advancement for the industry\" — such as its upcoming robotaxi service.\n\"The bottom line is that the stakes are incredibly high for the company at this point,\" Monteiro said. \"Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it.\"\nWith Musk acknowledging on Monday that he's running his other businesses, including Tesla, with \"great difficulty\" amid his DOGE work, one thing seems clear.\nThis is one deadline Wall Street doesn't want Musk to miss."

            "full_content": "Chinese automaker BYD continues to leave Tesla in the dust. The company introduced a new battery system on Monday that it claims can charge an electric vehicle in just five minutes, about the same time it takes to refuel a combustion car. The feat has long been a goal of the industry, which is still trying to overcome thorny hurdles around charging that have held potential buyers back.\nThe company specifically claims it can provide 249 miles of range in 5 minutes in its new Han L sedan. That compares to Tesla’s best charging rate, which can add 170 miles of range in 15 minutes at one of its high-voltage Superchargers. Elon Musk years ago bet big on an in-house battery to provide extended range to his company’s vehicles, but seemingly found battery development is harder than expected, as the 4860 battery has not lived up to expectations.\nBYDâs stock rose on the news to reach a market value of roughly $158 billion. It is up approximately 58% so far this year.\nThere has been some concern raised that fast charging such as that from BYD could shorten the overall lifespan of an EV battery, but there is little evidence thus far to support that idea. There are also concerns about how such charging could strain electrical grids.\nThe CEO of major Chinese battery maker CATL last year said Musk “doesn’t know how to make a battery” in an interview with Reuters.\nBYD, now the leading EV maker in China, was founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturing company, and only later entered the automotive market as it saw the future of cars would be as computers on wheels. It also assembles iPads for Apple. The company makes EVs at a range of prices, with its most affordable Seagull coming in at a starting price of just $9,700. It has been expanding across the world into markets like Europe and South America, building China’s soft power by creating local jobs and proving it can be successful outside the domestic Chinese market.\nThis all comes as Musk looks to handicap U.S. automotive companies by getting rid of subsidies that were helping the industry transition. Critics of China have complained that it uses subsidies to flood foreign markets with cheap products, but BYD is profitable on EVs now, and U.S. automakers could do the same if they had more time to reach scale. America was once a leader in automotive globally, but has decided to cede that position to China in favor of AI and crypto.\nThe transition to EVs has come with more growing pains than many in the industry expected, as charging infrastructure has been slow to expand and available chargers are frequently broken or slow. The existing infrastructure around gas-powered vehicles was developed over decades, however, and it makes sense it would similarly take time for EVs to reach maturity. Fast-charging capabilities could placate drivers who do not want to sit at chargers for a long time.\nBesides leapfrogging Tesla on price and battery performance, BYD also recently announced it will be adding advanced self-driving features to all of its vehicles. Reviewers have lauded BYDâs system for its performance.\nIt should all serve as a reminder that Tesla’s current valuation does not make a lot of sense. Sales have been cratering globally, the company sells fewer vehicles than BMW at lower profit margins, its vehicle lineup is dated, and full autonomy is years late. But Musk has pivoted to self-driving robocabs and robotics to keep the valuation afloat. Tesla stock has fallen 40% since the start of 2025 in part over intense backlash to Muskâs close involvement in the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Ross Gerber, one of Tesla’s most loyal investors called for Musk to step down from his position as CEO at the company.\nPerhaps if he was not spending all his time in Washington, Musk would have more time for Tesla, once the leader in electric vehicles but now second-tier compared to BYD. The power and proximity to President Trump is more valuable to him, it seems. It is certainly sad to think how much further ahead Tesla would be today if it had a full-time CEO not making the brand toxic.\n\nbatteriesbydChinaTESLA \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          In this day and age, technology like automated license plate readers make it trivial to hunt down vandals.\n        \n\n          The manufacturer is recalling 46,000 of the vehicles due to a faulty exterior panel, marking the eighth time it's been recalled.\n        \n\n          Spiderman pointing at Spiderman meme.\n        \n\n          Elon Musk told Fox News \"they basically want to kill me\" when discussing opposition to Tesla.\n        \n\n          As stock slumps and Americans turn against the automaker, its owners are paying higher insurance premiums.\n        \n\n          Turns out LiDAR might have some benefits.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Reid Hoffman has dismissed the idea that he has a personal \"beef\" with Elon Musk, saying their ongoing feud is one-sided.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, the LinkedIn cofounder and early OpenAI donor said Musk was still bitter over OpenAI's success after his departure. Musk left OpenAI in early 2018.\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\nHoffman added that AI should be developed by those willing to \"consult with and deal with other people\" — something he said Musk doesn't do. \"That's not how Elon operates, which anyone who has two eyes can see,\" he said.\nThe latest clash between the two played out over the weekend on X, the social media platform Musk owns. Musk claimed that Hoffman was among several donors funding Tesla protests.\n\"An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla 'protests,'\" Musk wrote on Saturday, listing Hoffman alongside George Soros and other political donors.\nAn investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.ActBlue funders include George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman,…\nHoffman fired back on Monday, calling Musk's claims false.\n\"Just one more of Elon's false claims about me: I never funded anyone for Tesla protests,\" Hoffman replied in a Monday X post. \"I don't condone violence. But it's clear Americans are angry at him—it's easier to explain away their anger than to accept that actions have consequences.\"Musk replied: \"Describe your favorite island vacation.\"\nHoffman shot back with a graph of Tesla's stock price decline, writing: \"I don't know about islands but here's your least favorite mountain.\"\nI don't know about islands but here's your least favorite mountain https://t.co/C89IkVZFU8 pic.twitter.com/cPeBMECvG8\nTesla stock closed down 15% on Monday, dragging Musk's net worth down by $29 billion — a 6.7% drop in a single day. Despite the hit, Musk remains the world's richest person.\nHoffman and Musk were both early OpenAI backers. Hoffman, who remained a supporter of OpenAI after Musk's departure, has been a vocal critic of Musk's actions. In September 2024, he dismissed Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI as \"sour grapes,\" suggesting Musk was frustrated by the company's success without him.\nLast month, Musk led a $97.4 billion bid to take control of OpenAI, which the company's board swiftly rejected.\nMusk and Hoffman did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment."

Tesla's February total in Germany fell 76% year-on-year, despite overall EV sales rising about 31%.

It wasn't immediately clear who created the website or if that person took it down.\nBusiness Insider spoke to eight individuals whose information was listed on the site. BI verified both their car ownership and sale, when applicable. Several sources requested anonymity to prevent further harassment. Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to BI's request for comment.\nThree of the people BI spoke with had already sold their cars. (The doxxing site said that those who wanted their information removed needed to email \"proof\" that they'd sold their vehicle.)\nSome of the personal information on the site, like addresses and phone numbers, was outdated, too. One Tesla owner told BI that he hadn't lived at the address listed for more than 20 years; another said he hadn't used the posted phone number since before he bought his car. The source of the data isn't clear.\nThe website is the latest in a series of protests against Tesla and its billionaire CEO, some of which have led to vandalized dealerships and destructed vehicles. Tesla owners have been a key target amid a growing movement against Musk, with some reporting harassment, road rage, and crude drawings on their vehicles. On Tuesday night, Attorney General Pam Bondi described the attacks at dealerships as \"domestic terrorism\" and said the Justice Department had charged multiple suspects.\nRegardless of their politics, the people BI spoke with didn't see that online doxxing as an effective form of protest against Elon Musk and the White House DOGE office. Bryant said in an email that he was \"livid\" about the text he received, which BI has seen screenshots of, and is \"not going to be intimidated by this mob!\"\n\"I think it's irresponsible and extra-judicial punishment for people that have nothing to do with what is going on in Washington,\" Victor Vescovo, who has owned a Tesla since 2016 and supports DOGE's mission, told BI on the phone. \nAnother, who said he's trying to sell his vehicle, said in a message that he supports \"whatever civil disobedience people take out on Tesla, the company, but it's upsetting to see people glorifying violence against owners.\" He said he used to be proud of his car, but now doesn't want to be associated with the brand.\n\"I think it's an example of the crazy times we live in,\" a person who bought their car in 2021 said about the site. \"The fact that somebody thought that this is a good idea, that it may move the needle in some sort of positive way, is concerning to me.\"\nOne owner who sold their Tesla after the election said they agree with the website's sentiment, \"but not the methods.\" The owner said while they are in a financial position to sell their vehicle, they have sympathy for others who cannot afford to do the same.\nMusk has spoken out about the recent vandalism in posts on X and addressed it in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday.\n\"I always thought that the left, you know, Democrats were supposed to be the party of empathy, the party of caring, and yet they're burning down cars, they're firebombing dealerships, they're firing bullets into dealerships, they're smashing up Teslas,\" he said.\nMost of the people BI spoke to were spooked by the site and had questions about where the data came from and who accessed it, but were not fearful for their safety. Vescovo was blunter; he said he might contact lawyers but isn't too worried about his vehicle being targeted.\n\"Not in Texas,\" he said. \"It's a pretty heavily armed state, and people are a little bit more careful about what they do here.\"\nHave a tip?

            "full_content": "Tesla owners selling up amid backlash against Elon Musk should be prepared to take a big loss.\nTesla resale values have collapsed in recent years, with the average price of a used Tesla now $10,000 less than that of a non-Tesla electric car, according to data from the dealership website CarGurus.\nUsed Tesla prices have been in freefall since 2022, dropping from a high of more than $70,000 to hit $30,000 in February, per CarGurus data. In the shorter term, prices have dropped about 10% since August, when the average Tesla resale price was more than $33,000.\nThe cheapest new Tesla on sale in 2025 is the Model 3, which costs more than $40,000 after estimated taxes and fees, according to Tesla's website.\nFresh evidence of falling resale prices has come as CEO Elon Musk's cost-cutting efforts at the White House DOGE office have sparked a backlash against the billionaire's car company, with some owners vowing to get rid of their cars as Tesla showrooms and vehicles become targets for protests and vandalism.\nThe singer Sheryl Crow said last month that she was selling her Tesla and donating the proceeds to NPR in a protest against Musk.\nThe angel investor Joanne Wilson, meanwhile, told Business Insider she was ditching her Model S and floated the idea of letting members of the public smash it with hammers.\nScott Oran, a real estate developer who lives near Boston, told BI he decided to sell his Model 3 after Musk's political moves left him \"embarrassed\" to be seen driving it.\nOran said he wanted to sell his Tesla as quickly as possible, adding that he was concerned that the number of Tesla owners flocking to sell their cars and the high-profile vandalism cases could see the resale value drop even further.\n\"I think, unfortunately, through Elon Musk's actions, he's probably irrevocably damaged the Tesla brand,\" Oran said.\nLackluster resale values have been a headache for Tesla owners for a while. The Tesla owner and investor Ross Gerber told BI he was struggling to sell his car at anything like fair market value last July.\nUsed EVs have become more affordable as a growing number of new electric models have hit the market.\nTeslas are now by far the most common vehicle on the used electric market, per CarGurus' data. The rental giant Hertz listed more than 30,000 Tesla vehicles from its fleet for sale last year.\nKevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence for CarGurus, told BI: \"Tesla has been the dominant EV brand on the new vehicle market for years, which means there's going to be a lot more of them on the used market.\" \nDemand for used Teslas has also been hit by price reductions on new vehicles in a bid to drive sales, Roberts said, adding that used EV prices were probably \"close to a floor\" after years of falls. \nTesla's share price has plummeted in recent months, dropping more than 50% since December, having surged in the weeks after Donald Trump's election victory. On Monday alone, the stock dropped 15%, cutting Musk's net worth by $29 billion in a single day.\nWith sales falling in Europe and China, the automaker is gearing up to introduce more affordable models this summer and is also planning to launch a robotaxi service in Austin in June.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.\nDo you own a Tesla or have a tip?

This poor guy, you do one, maybe two Nazi salutes, and everybody gets all bent out of shape.\"\nMusk reacted to the jokes in an X post, calling Kimmel an \"unfunny jerk.\"\nThe talk show host has been a vocal critic of Musk and President Donald Trump, and even called out Trump onstage at the 2024 Oscars.\nKimmel doubled down on Musk on his Thursday show, continuing to poke fun at the Tesla CEO and highlighting Tesla's Cybertruck recall.\n\"Tesla is not having a good week. Today they issued a recall of nearly all 46,000 of their Cybertrucks. That's the eighth Cybertruck recall since they came out in November of 2023. It's 15 months — eight recalls,\" he said.\n\"I mentioned last night multiple Teslas were burned at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas. Authorities are now investigating which Teslas were set on fire — and which set themselves on fire.\"\nKimmel continued to joke about violent protests and suggested that some were seemingly more acceptable than others.\n\"And while no one should be setting anything on fire, ever, people are mad at Elon Musk for randomly and gleefully putting thousands of Americans out of work, including veterans. But the MAGA gang, which has been very against any kind of violent protest since January 7, was it? 2021? That's when they started being against it — they are highly upset,\" he said.\nMusk did not respond to Kimmel's second joke on X."

She said she started questioning her ownership when Musk \"started getting onto the ticket of the extreme far right.\"\nPrama said there was \"no turning back\" for her after Musk's \"Nazi gesture.\"\nMusk has denied the gesture was a Nazi salute, calling the claims \"ridiculous\" in an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast last month.\nLed By Donkey said in a Facebook post: \"Thousands of people are ditching Tesla. Here's one of them with a message you can see from space.\" The slogan is said to be about 800 feet long.\nA spokesperson for the group told BI the video's message was \"clear\" — \"to fight the oligarchs taking unaccountable power, we need to hit their bottom line.\"\nLed By Donkeys, initially set up as an anti-Brexit group, has frequently targeted Musk in recent months over his support for Trump and right-wing European parties such as Germany's AfD.

Tesla showrooms and vehicles have also become targets for protests and vandalism.\nTesla stock has been under pressure, falling 37% this year.

            "full_content": "At xAI, Elon Musk has marshaled a workforce that has ballooned by more than 1,000 employees in less than two years as he goes head-to-head with rivals OpenAI and Google.\nBusiness Insider reviewed the company's internal organizational chart to identify and understand the people near the top of the AI venture as of early this year. The chart, which included names, titles, and other information, features former Tesla and Google engineers, Musk's home office manager, and his son.\nAs CEO, Musk oversees a team of more than 1,200 people. Five employees report directly to the billionaire: xAI founding team members Igor Babuschkin, Ross Nordeen, and Jimmy Ba; longtime Musk aide Jared Birchall; and Daniel Rowland, whose involvement in the company hasn't been previously reported.\nA spokesperson for xAI did not respond to a request for comment.\nMusk, Ba, Rowland, Birchall, Babuschkin, and Nordeen did not respond to a request for comment.\nHere's what we know about Musk's direct reports.\nBa was one of Musk's first hires at xAI. He appeared on a livestream alongside Musk and a handful of other xAI employees when the company unveiled the latest version of Grok in February.\nSeveral of Ba's direct reports joined the company as \"Member of Technical Staff\" within the past few months, including Pawan Bhandarkar and Satvik Ramaprasad, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nMost xAI employees roll up to Ba, including around 900 AI \"tutors,\" the hourly employees who train the company's chatbot, Grok. These workers report to team leads who are overseen by \"human data managers.\" The majority of tutors work remotely, and some work outside the US.\nOutside his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. He's part of the Machine Learning Group, faculty from the computer science department who work on various projects involving artificial intelligence. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under the Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, who has been referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\nRowland joined xAI nearly a year ago and oversees both of xAI's data centers, according to the organizational chart.\nThe company built its Memphis data center — which Musk has said is the largest in the world, and which the company has said houses more than 200,000 GPUs — in 122 days, a fraction of the time it typically takes to build such a facility. The company also has two other facilities in Memphis, including a wastewater treatment plant and a site that was announced in March. Musk has said the company plans to scale the site, which he has nicknamed \"Colossus,\" to 2 million GPUs in the coming year.\nxAI also quietly set up a data center in Atlanta in December that houses about 12,000 GPUs.\nRowland has a team of a few dozen people, including eight direct reports. In January, two of those employees left Tesla's Dojo project, which is focused on building the carmaker's custom supercomputer, to join the data center project, LinkedIn profiles show.\nBrent Mayo, a former SpaceX engineer, also reports to Rowland. Mayo has become the face of xAI in Memphis, where he frequently engages with local officials and serves as the senior manager of site builds and infrastructure. Rowland's other direct reports include Alexander Coppess, Andy Kim, Lee Meyer, and Liz Balke.\nRowland's team is primarily based out of Memphis, but he has one employee listed as a data center technician based in Atlanta.\nBI was unable to confirm details of Rowland's professional background. A hardware engineer named Daniel Rowland has worked on Tesla's Dojo supercomputer since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile and internal documentation reviewed by BI.\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nBabuschkin previously worked at Google DeepMind.\nBabuschkin manages the most people directly at xAI, with 29 direct reports. One of his team members includes Kai Musk, Elon Musk's son, according to the chart. Musk is listed in xAI's directory as an \"Engineering Intern\" on the company's \"Engineering Strike Team.\" His involvement with the company has not been previously reported.\nWhen asked about his position at the company, Kai Musk responded from his xAI email address that \"this information is incorrect.\" He declined to comment further and did not respond to follow-up questions.\nBabuschkin also oversees members of the company's \"xAI Partner\" department, including Marko Elez and Aram Moghaddassi, two people who have been connected to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\nBoth previously worked at Musk's X and Neuralink, according to Moghaddassi's LinkedIn profile and an archived version of Elez's LinkedIn profile. Elez was listed as an \"active\" employee at xAI in February; four days after BI reached out to xAI about his employment, his company email address stopped working.\nOther people listed as members of the xAI Partner department under Babuschkin include Aqueel Miqdad and Anton Shevchenko, who both list X as their current employer on LinkedIn.\nBirchall is listed as an \"xAI Partner\" on the organizational chart, but he does not report to Babuschkin. His team includes members of the finance, legal, security, and HR teams. His direct reports include Robert Ochoa, the human resources lead; Robert Keele, the legal lead; and Pablo Mendoza, the finance lead.\nBirchall, like Rowland, is listed as a remote employee.\nThe former Morgan Stanley banker also serves as the CEO of Musk's brain chip startup, Neuralink, and he has run Musk's family office for nine years.\nNordeen has no direct reports. He was a technical program manager at Tesla before he joined xAI in 2023, according to an internal Tesla database from December 2021.\nDo you work for xAI or one of Musk's companies?

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump has unleashed economic warfare on two of America’s most closely aligned trading partners (and political allies): Mexico and Canada. On Tuesday, the Trump administration put into effect its long-threatened tariffs on consumer goods from both of those countries, with the President claiming that the tariffs were necessary to stem the tide of illegal immigrants flowing into the United States.\nIn response, those countries have instituted many of their own retaliatory tariffs and economic punishments on American products, including some targeted at Trump’s political partner, DOGE douchebag Elon Musk.\nOn Tuesday, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario (Canada’s most populous province), announced the termination of a 100 million Canadian dollar (~$68 million American) contract with Musk’s satellite company, Starlink. “It’s done, it’s gone,” Ford said at a press conference, referencing the Starlink deal. “We won’t award contracts to people who enable and encourage economic attacks on our province and our country.”\nAdditionally, Ford said that American companies would be forbidden from bidding on the $30 billion worth of procurement contracts that are annually paid out by the province’s government. “U.S.-based businesses will now lose out on tens of billions of dollars in revenues,” Ford said. “They only have President Trump to blame.”\nAt the same time, a former high-ranking official has proposed instituting a blanket tariff on Musk’s car company, Tesla. âWe are going to go after American stakeholders who matter to the White House. I have proposed a 100 percent tariff on all Teslas,” Chrystia Freeland, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, recently announced. Freeland recently stepped down from her post to run for the slot of Canadian prime minister. “I am calling on all the countries that are affected by this tariff to join us, and our retaliation will target specific Trump constituencies,â Freeland added.\nIt’s the latest sign that a decent chunk of Canadians hate Musk. Some 230,000 Canadians also recently signed a petition aimed at revoking Musk’s Canadian citizenship (Musk has Canadian citizenship because his mother, Maye Musk, was born in Saskatchewan). The petition accused the billionaire of âattempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.â In response to the petition, Musk tweeted that Canada was “not a real country,” presumably inspiring more animosity against himself and his companies.\nMusk is also hated by many Europeans (largely due to the billionaire’s meddling in EU nations’ politics), and by millions of Americans, and, presumably, by people from many other parts of the world. Recently released statistics showed that Tesla sales were plummeting across European nations, as well as in Californiaâwhich had previously been the company’s stronghold. The EV maker’s sales in Australia are down 70 percent.\nAdditionally, Tesla has suffered a growing onslaught of vandalism ever since Musk became a prominent fixture of the Trump administration. Dealerships across the U.S. have been vandalized, shot up, and set on fire, and a growing protest movement is taking aim at the company’s bottom line.\n\nDonald TrumpElon MuskTESLA \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Ford EV owners can now find Tesla Superchargers via Apple Maps, and they can charge more easily and reliably.\n  \nFord's new NACS Fast Charging Adapter is easier to hold and connects more securely.\nIt's been a year since Ford's EVs unlocked third-party access to Tesla's Supercharger network using complimentary NACS Fast Charging Adapters. This week, the automaker doubled down on its commitment to the North American Charging System, adding NACS Fast Charger Routing via Apple Maps in CarPlay and a second-gen NACS Fast Charging Adapter adapter for its F-150 Lighting electric pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV. The new adapter promises to be easier and more reliable to use.\nIn 2023, Ford was the first of a deluge of automakers to announce support for the Tesla-pioneered North American Charging System. A year later, it was the first to make good on the pledge by supplying a free NACS charging adapter to any owner who requested one between February and June of 2024. Today, one year later, Ford has fulfilled that initial commitment, shipping around 140,000 complementary adapters to reservation holders across the US. According to the automaker, its drivers make extensive use of those adapters. Nearly 20% of Ford EV charging visits away from home happen at Tesla Supercharger stations.\nNACS and Tesla Supercharger stations now appear as suggestions when planning large trips via Apple CarPlay.\nThe addition of Tesla's V3 Superchargers grows the BlueOval Charge Network -- Ford's database of compatible charging stations -- to an estimated 44,000 DC fast charging points across North America. Drivers can find and navigate to those stations via their vehicle's on-board navigation, the FordPass app and, now, Apple Maps EV Routing.\nJust yesterday, Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning drivers gained the ability to include NACS fast charging stations into trips calculated via Apple Maps EV Routing in CarPlay. Apple Maps can now detect the host EV's state of charge to calculate when you'll need to plug in and can suggest charging stops along the route, including Tesla Superchargers, when planning longer trips. Suggested stops at NACS stations include a warning reminding you to bring the Fast Charging Adapter. However, because Apple CarPlay is separate from the core EV systems, battery preconditioning is not supported alongside Apple Maps EV routing.\nTo test the new adapter, Ford and Lectron subjected it to snow, water, impact and even a crush test beneath an F-150 Lightning EV.\nToday, Ford also announced the second-gen NACS adapter. Co-developed with EV charging accessory manufacturer Lectron, the new Ford Fast Charging Adapter is said to be more robust and reliable, able to stand up to a wide variety of climates, conditions and abuses that owners may subject it to over the vehicle's lifetime -- from snow to water submersion to being run over by an F-150 Lightning electric truck. The adapter has an integrated handle that's more ergonomic and easier to grip than the stubby previous generation, as well as new vehicle interlock that prevents accidentally unplugging the adapter during charging.\nAt $200 when ordered from Ford's website or service centers, the new Ford Fast Charging Adapter is also slightly cheaper than its $230 predecessor -- and given Lectron's experience building and shipping its own adapter, I'd wager it's also more likely to be in stock.\n\n      Article updated on March 11, 2025 at 5:00 AM PDT\n      \nWe thoroughly evaluate each company and product we review and ensure our stories meet our high editorial standards."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk told investors to expect Tesla sales to grow this year — but plummeting sales in a number of countries are complicating that goal.\nWhile Tesla's Model Y continues to be a top seller and UK sales were up in February, some of Tesla's sales figures in other markets looked grim — the kind of year-over-year drops that should worry the CEO.\nTesla sales in February declined 71% year over year in Australia, according to figures from the Electric Vehicle Council. The EV giant sold 1,592 vehicles in Australia last month, down from 5,665 in February the year prior.\nTesla Rival Polestar sold 125 vehicles last month, which was also a decline of 11%.\nThe decline of Tesla sales in Australia this month comes amid vandalism in the country aimed at Musk. A Tesla store in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, was vandalized with graffiti, news.com.au reported this week.\nTesla's sales in Germany last month were down by 76% year over year, with 1,429 vehicles sold. Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority said overall EV sales in the country grew by about 31%.\nTesla's sales in the country also fell in January, when Musk endorsed the far-right AfD party ahead of a February 23 election.\nTesla sales declined in several other European countries last month.\nIn February, Tesla sales in Norway and Denmark were down by 48% year over year.\nSales in Sweden declined by 42% year over year.\nTesla sales in France last month declined by 26% year over year: It sold 2,395 vehicles, though that was an increase from 1,141 Teslas sold in January. The country also experienced an overall decline in car sales of 0.7%, Plateforme Automobile said.\nJanuary Tesla registrations in the US fell 11% year over year, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. While sales were down, Tesla still has a leading market share in the US with 42% of total EV sales, according to the data.\nHowever, Tesla's decline came as its rivals saw an increase. Ford's EV registrations surged 54% from the year prior, and Chevrolet and VW also saw increases, S&P Global Mobility said. Tesla still sold 35,000 more EVs than Ford last month.\nSlumping sales in the US come as a series of recent anti-Musk protests and boycott efforts have been aimed at Tesla in response to the billionaire's political involvement. A number of vandalism incidents involving Molotov cocktails, suspected arson, and gunfire have also taken place, with some leading to arrests.\nSales of Teslas manufactured in China also took a hit in February. The EV giant sold 30,688 China-made vehicles, its lowest number since August 2022. That represented a 49% drop year over year in China. Tesla's Chinese rival BYD recorded a 90.4% increase in vehicle sales that month.\nTesla's stock dropped by about 4% in early trading on Tuesday but has since leveled out. However, after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, Tesla shares are still trading down about 36% year to date.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\nWhile Tesla has faced increasing competition in the EV market in recent years, some investors have expressed concerns that Tesla could be struggling in part because of Musk's involvement in global politics and position in the Trump administration with DOGE.\nIn recent weeks, several \"Tesla Takedown\" protests have occurred in various cities in response to his political involvement, with demonstrators urging Tesla owners to sell their vehicles.\nIn an apparent effort to boost sales of its most expensive Cybertruck models, which cost nearly $100,000, Tesla is offering free charging for the entire period of ownership."

            "full_content": "Since the beginning of the year, Tesla's stock has dropped almost 42%, shedding some $500 billion in market value. As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News viewers, it's the perfect time to buy.\n\"If you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\" Lutnick said on Jesse Watters' show Wednesday. \"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap,\" he added, referring to CEO Elon Musk. \"It'll never be this cheap again.\"\nLutnick's comments were the latest example of members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, using their political standing to promote a specific company — a concerning break with long-standing tradition, ethics experts say.\n\"It's an ethics issue, and it's an optics issue,\" said Jordan Libowitz, head of communications for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Whether or not there is some kind of quid quo pro here, people will question it. It will at least raise eyebrows when someone spends hundreds of millions of dollars to elect a president and then that president's administration takes action that appears to be an attempt to boost that person's net worth.\"\nRichard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer under President George Bush, said government officials have historically steered clear of picking favorites. \"The idea of promoting a company, the White House doesn't do that,\" he said. \"The Commerce Secretary is not Jim Cramer.\"\nSpokespeople for the Department of Commerce, the White House, and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMusk's firing of thousands of government employees in his role as de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency sparked a protest movement called #TeslaTakedown. Over the last two months, protesters have set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations. Sales have also dropped as buyers boycott the brand.\nThe administration has rushed to support Musk's company. Last week, President Trump held what was effectively a promotional event on the grounds of the White House, posing for photographs in front of Teslas lined up along the South Lawn. Trump agreed to buy a Model S, writing in a Truth Social post ahead of the event that his purchase was a \"show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\" Trump said he would write a check for $80,000, though it's unclear if he ever did.\nEthics experts say it's virtually unprecedented for members of an administration to throw their weight behind a single company. While the government has supported specific industries or bailed out companies in the past, its actions have been couched in the context of protecting American jobs, Libowitz said.\nPainter and Kathleen Clark, a professor of law at Washington University, said Lutnick's comments violate a section of the federal code that says government employees may not use their office for their own private gain; that of their friends, relatives, or other affiliates; or to endorse \"any product, service, or enterprise.\"\nLutnick said he would divest his financial holdings within 90 days of joining the government, as is standard practice. It's unclear whether he has done so. According to the most recent security filings, one of Lutnick's holdings, the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, owns Tesla stock. Also on Wednesday, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard upgraded Tesla to the equivalent of a \"buy\" rating after visiting one of its factories.\n\"When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building,\" Lutnick said on Fox, \"people are going to be dreaming of today.\"\nThis isn't the first time an administration has touted a specific business. Less than a month into the first Trump administration, the president's close advisor, Kellyanne Conway, told Fox viewers to support Ivanka Trump's fashion line. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff, is what I would say,\" Conway said. At the time, Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the comments were \"wrong, wrong, wrong, and there's no excuse for it,\" The New York Times reported. Chaffetz and the then-top Democratic lawmaker on the committee, Elijah Cummings, wrote a letter to the US Office of Government Ethics, and then-press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had been \"counseled\" on the matter.\nOthers who wanted to curry favor with Trump during his first administration chose to stay at his hotel in Washington DC or play golf at Trump courses. When Joe Biden became president in 2021, he kept his name on the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania, which Painter said the university used to raise funds — an arrangement that rankled the ethics lawyer. \"The use of the president's name to sell cars, to raise money for a private university, is unacceptable. It never happened before 2016,\" Painter said. \"This Tesla thing is not good.\"\nNor is it very helpful for the company, at least in the short run. Despite the administration's efforts, Tesla's downward momentum hasn't reversed. Its shares rose 1.3% on Thursday, closing at $236, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December. Its stock price is on pace for its ninth straight weekly decline."

            "full_content": "During his record-setting joint address to Congress, President Donald Trump continued calling Elon Musk the leader of the White House DOGE office.\n\"I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, perhaps you've heard of it, which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight,\" Trump said in his speech Tuesday night.\nTrump's habit of saying Musk is in charge of the group has already created legal headaches for his administration, which has repeatedly said the Tesla CEO is not actually leading DOGE.\nA group of plaintiffs challenging DOGE's constitutionality immediately alerted a Washington, DC, federal judge to Trump's comments almost as soon as the president finished his speech.\n\"At approximately 9:46 PM, President Trump stated the following in his Joint Address to Congress,\" the plaintiffs wrote in their filing.\nThe plaintiffs, who include two attorneys, quickly filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on the day Trump was sworn into office, arguing that the creation of DOGE violates the transparency requirements of the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act. The lawsuit declares DOGE a federal advisory committee that should be subject to the FACA law.\nThe law, which was designed to boost public accountability, covers advisory committees that are either formed or utilized by the president.\nAn amended lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs says \"Musk continues to speak for DOGE and take credit for DOGE's activities, while not being\" the administrator for the US DOGE Service.\nDOGE was birthed out of a rebrand of the United States Digital Service — a technology unit housed in the executive office of the president.\n\"DOGE continues to take actions which are completely unrelated to the USDS mandate set forth\" in Trump's day one executive order that formally established DOGE, the amended complaint says.\nUS District Judge Jia Cobb has since consolidated the case with two other similar cases.\nTrump's joint address comments were cited in another court filing in a Maryland case brought against Musk and DOGE by 26 current and former USAID employees or contractors.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs on Wednesday filed a letter to the federal judge overseeing the case asking the court \"to take judicial notice of these relevant admissions.\"\n\"Plaintiffs respectfully write to bring to the Court's attention additional relevant admissions made last night. Defendants consent to providing these facts to the Court,\" the letter read. \"During his joint address to Congress, President Donald Trump twice identified Defendant Musk as DOGE's leader.\"\nThe plaintiffs' lawsuit alleges that Musk's actions in the Trump administration are \"unconstitutional.\"\nAnd a new lawsuit filed on Wednesday in Washington, DC, federal court against Musk and the Trump administration also cites Trump's joint address speech.\n\"Mr. Musk is acting as a principal officer of the United States. However, Mr. Musk has not been appointed to a position as an officer of the United States, in accordance with the Appointments Clause,\" says the lawsuit, which was brought by a group of nonprofits, including the Japanese American Citizens League.\nMeanwhile, a top White House official previously said in federal court that Musk was neither the DOGE office administrator nor even an employee of the group. The White House has also repeatedly stressed that Musk is just a senior advisor to the president. After weeks of refusing to name DOGE's administrator publicly, the White House said that Amy Gleason, a US Digital Service employee, was the acting administrator of the DOGE office.\nMultiple signs suggest that Musk remains DOGE's de facto leader, dating back to Trump's initial creation of \"The Department of Government Efficiency,\" when he named the billionaire as its co-leader.\nJust days ago, a Department of Justice lawyer struggled to answer questions from a district court judge about DOGE's structure. Anna Bower, a Lawfare editor, posted part of the exchange on X.\n\"Who was the head of DOGE before Amy Gleason?\" Judge Theodore Chuang asked the DOJ attorney, Joshua Gardner.\n\"I can't answer that. I don't know,\" Gardner responded.\nTrump is no stranger to making public statements that create headaches for the Justice Department.\nDuring his first term, Trump's tweets were repeatedly used as evidence in various lawsuits brought against his administration.\nAt one point, the DOJ said that Trump's tweets were not presidential actions.\nThe White House didn't immediately return a request for comment from Business Insider."

            "full_content": "President Donald Trump last week said Tesla CEO Elon Musk runs the White House DOGE office — but Amy Gleason, officially DOGE's acting administrator, swears they don't work together.\nIn a court filing related to a lawsuit against the US DOGE Service by the nonprofit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Gleason said that Musk \"does not work\" for the US DOGE Service.\nWhile Gleason's statement outlined the official structure of the DOGE office, it remains unclear exactly how decisions are made at the agency and who must sign off on them. The White House DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs, many of which have been reversed by court order.\n\"Elon Musk does not work at USDS,\" Gleason's statement reads, referring to the US DOGE Service, which was renamed from the United States Digital Service via an executive order Trump issued on January 20.\n\"I do not report to him, and he does not report to me,\" Gleason continued. \"To my knowledge, he is a Senior Advisor to the White House.\"\nGleason, who in early March was identified as the acting administrator of the recently-renamed department, went on to clarify that she reports to the White House Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, and Gleason herself oversees \"all of USDS's employees and detailees to USDS from other agencies.\"\nA former colleague of Gleason previously told Business Insider that she is hardworking and apolitical, and had earned the nickname \"the green dot\" for being active on the office messaging system all hours of the day and night.\nThe filing in which Gleason's declaration appears stems from a lawsuit against the DOGE office filed by the government accountability watchdog group CREW. The nonprofit described the lawsuit in a press release as an attempt to \"compel transparency\" at the department.\nThe judge in the case this week ruled the DOGE office must release some records per Freedom of Information Act requests, describing the department as operating rapidly and with \"unusual secrecy,\" Business Insider previously reported.\nThe Friday filing featuring Gleason's declaration was a motion requesting the judge reconsider that decision \"to prevent manifest injustice\" and outlining the DOGE Office's plans to argue it is not subject to FOIA.\nRepresentatives for the White House, DOGE office, and CREW did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\nHave a tip?

            "full_content": "X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has been suffering from outages all day Monday. And owner Elon Musk has finally said what’s behind it. Well, what he thinks is behind it. The billionaire oligarch says X is being hit with a “major cyberattack,” though he didn’t present any evidence to back up his claim.\n“There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against X,” Musk tweeted Monday afternoon. “We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing â¦”\nMusk appears to just be speculating about the cause of the outages, given how he leaves everything so open-ended. And it’s important to remember that Musk has a long history of just lying about various topics. One recent example was on Joe Rogan, when Musk lied about several things, including the idea that Tesla didn’t have any employees when he joined the company. Musk has long tried to take credit for founding the company, something that isn’t true. And Musk was asked about that by Rogan, prompting the billionaire to double down on his lies.\nLater in the day, Musk tried to suggest on Fox Business while talking to Larry Kudlow that Ukraine may have been behind the outage, though he again didn’t provide any evidence for his assertion.\nElon Musk blames Ukraine for what he describes as cyberattacks on X\nâ Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 10, 2025 at 1:35 PM\nX has experienced several relatively small outages since Musk bought the website in October 2022, but Monday’s ongoing outage is a bad one. Strangely, there does appear to be significant regional differences in who can get on X. One Gizmodo writer working in Southern California was having intermittent outages Monday but was able to access the site as of this writing. Other Gizmodo employees in New York and South Carolina, however, were not able to access the platform.\nIf X is under a DDoS attack, who might really be behind it? There are frankly too many potential suspects to count. Musk has pissed off a lot of people in recent months, first by helping get President Donald Trump elected with at least $277 million in campaign donations. Musk then made two Nazi-style salutes the day Trump was inaugurated, something he later denied was meant to invoke Nazi Germany. The oligarch then went to work illegally dismantling federal agencies like USAID and sending his team of DOGE dipshits to penetrate sensitive government data, including everything from tax return information at the U.S. Treasury Department to Social Security databases.\nWe may never get a real answer for why X is struggling today, but you can rest assured that whatever’s actually happening, Musk will capitalize on it to claim he’s a victim. That’s the MAGA mindset, and it doesn’t matter that Musk is the wealthiest man in the world. These guys always find a way to sound like they’re an oppressed minority.\nMusk and his company, Tesla, have been the target of sustained protests in recent weeks at dealerships across the country. And rather than admitting people might earnestly dislike the fascist takeover he’s orchestrating, the billionaire is trying to insist it’s the result of wealthy liberals like George Soros who are out to hurt him.\n“An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla ‘protests’: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America,” Musk wrote on Saturday.\nActBlue is essentially just a payments processor, but Musk tries to make it sound like a shadowy group out to get him. If you made a donation to any Democratic-aligned group or candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, there’s a good chance ActBlue showed up on your billing statement.\n“ActBlue funders include George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix,” Musk continued. “ActBlue is currently under investigation for allowing foreign and illegal donations in criminal violation of campaign finance regulations. This week, 7 ActBlue senior officials resigned, including the associate general counsel.”\nIt should be noted that Herbert Sandler died in 2019, Patricia Bauman died in 2024, and George Soros no longer makes public appearances because of his age. Musk doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about. But he’s going to keep blaming dead people for the righteous anger that’s bubbled up.\nX didn’t immediately respond to questions emailed on Monday.

            "full_content": "This battery breakthrough would be good news for the EV industry.\n  \nBYD's claims, if true, could upend the market for EVs and alleviate range anxiety for potential buyers.\nAn automaker says it has developed technology that speeds up electric vehicle battery charging to as little as 5 minutes at 1,000 kilowatts, which could provide almost 250 miles of driving range. \nThe potential battery breakthrough was announced on a livestream on Monday by Chinese auto manufacturer BYD's CEO Wang Chuanfu and sent the company's stock soaring. The charging technology would provide fuel-ups at twice the speed that Tesla currently offers at its Supercharger stations.\nBYD says it plans to deploy the charging-infrastructure technology in China. The batteries that can charge that quickly will initially be built into two new vehicles from the company, a sedan and an SUV.\nThe company didn't say how soon it would build that infrastructure or when those vehicles might be available. \nA representative for BYD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIf the stated range from BYD is accurate, it could go a long way toward alleviating one of the major impediments for potential US buyers of EVs: range anxiety. For long-range travel across the US, EV owners must plan their trips based on the availability of EV charging locations given that their average range is typically between 200 and 300 miles per charge. But recent policy changes and climate-focused reversals have called into question whether EV networks, such as Tesla's, will continue to expand in the US. Last year, Tesla laid off about 500 workers from its Supercharger team.\nChinese EV companies have been growing quickly and are hoping to get a foothold in other markets as Tesla, the leading US EV manufacturer, has faced backlash over CEO Elon Musk's political activity and other issues. \nFaster EV charging could mean more turnover at existing EV charging stations, and shorter wait times for EV owners. BYD says its new technology makes charging an EV comparable to a gas-powered car in terms of the time it takes to refuel. \nRyan Rohrman, the CEO of Rohrman Automotive Group, an auto dealer in the Midwest that serves multiple states, said BYD's news could move the needle for the EV industry.\n\"If BYD's announcement is accurate, it could significantly boost the adoption of EVs,\" Rohrman said. \"Range anxiety remains a major concern, but the ability to recharge an EV as quickly as refueling a gas-powered car would eliminate that worry. The next challenge to tackle is ensuring there are enough charging stations to support widespread use.\"\n\n      Article updated on March 23, 2025 at 5:05 AM PDT\n      \nWe thoroughly evaluate each company and product we review and ensure our stories meet our high editorial standards."

Musk's private jet arrived in Austin just two hours before he addressed workers in the Texas Gigafactory.\nMusk spent the first half of the hour-long call providing updates on Tesla, touching on the company's safety record, delivery figures, and its progress in autonomous driving and robotics.\nHe then spent the rest of the session taking questions from his employees.\nTesla has been facing headwinds in recent months. The carmaker's stock is down more than 37% year-to-date and a series of protests have erupted across Tesla sales and service centers over the past few weeks.\n\"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?\" Musk said on Thursday night.\n\"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable,\" he continued.\nMusk also talked about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions during the meeting, saying that self-driving will unlock the company's true value.\n\"It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,\" Musk told his workers.\n\"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nDo you work at Tesla or have a tip?

            "full_content": "Sen. Mark Kelly has become the latest big name to get rid of his Tesla over Elon Musk's politics.\nThe Arizona Democrat posted a video Thursday marking his \"last trip\" driving his Tesla. He wrote in the caption that he'd bought it because it was \"fast like a rocket ship\" but that driving it had come to \"feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people.\"\n\"I think it's time to get rid of it,\" he said in the video, using an expletive to refer to Musk and saying he didn't want to drive a car designed by such a person.\nI bought a Tesla because it was fast like a rocket ship. But now every time I drive it, I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you’re fired!New ride coming soon. pic.twitter.com/N4Anmsi6cH\nHe'd told reporters earlier this week that he was \"looking into\" selling his Tesla, though he noted \"there's things I like about it.\"\n\"It's kind of cheaply built on the inside, but I love the performance,\" he said Tuesday.\nHis remarks come amid his recent dust-up with Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, who called the senator a \"traitor\" for visiting Ukraine.\nKelly isn't the first prominent figure to part with his Tesla. Some other big names have offloaded their Teslas because of Musk.\nThe actor told vice presidential candidate Tim Walz in October that he had ditched his Tesla.\n\"I feel like I'm driving around [with] a Trump sticker with that car, so it's gone,\" he said on an episode of his hit podcast \"Smartless.\"\n\"I'm so excited that every car brand now has an electric car,\" Bateman added.\nBateman appeared in a Hyundai ad for the carmaker's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle in 2022.\nThe singer posted a video on Instagram in February showing her waving goodbye to her Tesla as it was towed away.\n\"My parents always said… you are who you hang out with,\" she wrote in the caption. \"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla.\"\nCrow said she donated the money from the sale of her Tesla to NPR, which Musk has criticized and called to defund. NPR says it receives less than 1% of its funding directly from the federal government.\nAngel investor Joanne Wilson told Business Insider that she and her venture capitalist husband, Fred Wilson, sold their Tesla in protest of Musk's actions at DOGE.\nShe wrote a blog post about their decision this week.\n\"Was it Elon's complete disregard for human beings as he attempts to completely disrupt the federal government like a classic tech dude without a proper understanding of how government works, or was it that awful new cyber truck that looks like something out of Mad Max and looks angry?\" she wrote. \"It is a toss-up.\"\n\"Tesla takedown\" protests have sprung up in cities across the US in opposition to Musk's work at DOGE. Protesters are calling for Tesla owners to sell their stock and cars, and some Tesla owners have seen their vehicles get vandalized.\nHowever, Tesla recently got at least one prominent buyer: Trump.\nThe President said Tuesday he'll label attacks against Tesla dealerships domestic terrorism and said he plans to buy a Tesla Model S and a Cybertruck to support Musk. In a Tuesday photo op outside the White House, he got inside a Model S and sounded impressed by its interior, saying, \"Everything's computer!\"\nTesla's stock has plummeted more than 50% from its December all-time high, but it rose following Trump saying he'd purchase a new Tesla."

            "full_content": "Ron Baron said his asset management firm Baron Capital sold Tesla shares last month after concerns that its position was becoming too large.\n\"Everyone, you know, has to deal with certain clientele,\" Baron said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"And I deal with the critiques of my clientele for how large the positions are.\"\nIt's not the first time Baron Capital trimmed its Tesla stake. After selling about 1.8 million shares in March of 2021 after its assets were getting too big, the firm sold some of its shares again in the second quarter of 2024 for the same reason, Baron said.\nBaron, who serves as chairman and CEO of Baron Capital, said the firm sold about 5% more last month than it did in the second quarter. The firm now has around two-thirds of the Telsa stock it bought between 2014 and 2016, which was about $400 million, he added. The mutual fund manager said Tesla makes up about 12% of the firm's assets and SpaceX makes up about 9%.\nThe move comes as Tesla has seen its shares plunge recently after a postelection surge that saw the stock hit an all-time high in December. Tesla sales declined across several European countries and China in February, according to vehicle registration data, and the share price has since wiped out the postelection gains, closing down over 15% on Monday.\nIn recent weeks, protests and calls for a Tesla boycott have cropped up in response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political involvement, and police have investigated multiple incidents of vandalism at Tesla dealerships. \nBaron said he sees the stock market's downturn as a potential positive. The longtime Tesla bull said he \"didn't sell any\" of his own shares in the company, and thinks the stock downturn is an opportunity for investors.\n\"I was thinking we would make four times over the next 10 years,\" Baron said about Tesla. \"I think we're gonna make more than that now from these prices.\"\nWhile Baron said people may be \"unsettled\" at the stock market's recent fluctuation under Trump, he suggested what's happening in regard to the economy may be intentional and an effort to decrease inflation.\n\"In a year from now, things will look better,\" Baron said, adding that he \"can't believe how cheap\" the stock prices are.\nHe also reiterated his support for Musk's leadership at Tesla, calling him an \"incredibly consequential person\" and \"unbelievable engineer,\" despite personally disagreeing with a CEO being so politically outspoken. He said he \"won't sell a single share personally\" until he's sold all Tesla shares for his clients.\n\"You wouldn't have a business without him, you wouldn't have EVs without him, you wouldn't have autonomous driving without him, you wouldn't have the internet on every inch of the planet without him, you wouldn't have rockets that you can use over without him,\" Baron said."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk shows off a \"DOGE\" shirt after stepping off Marine One upon arrival to the White House in Washington, D.C. on March 9, 2025. \nWASHINGTON — Elon Musk pushed debunked theories about Social Security on Monday while describing federal benefit programs as rife with fraud, suggesting they will be a primary target in his crusade to reduce government spending.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur, who is advising President Donald Trump, suggested that $500 billion to $700 billion in waste needed to be cut.\n“Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” Musk told the Fox Business Network. “That’s the big one to eliminate.”\nThe comments on the popular program and other benefits provided to Americans could rattle politicians on both sides of the aisle as Musk works to downsize the federal government, especially as he already faces blowback for his chainsaw-wielding approach to laying off workers and slashing programs.\nRead More: What DOGE Is Doing Across the Federal Government\nMusk’s estimate for the level of fraud in entitlements far outpaces figures from watchdogs like Social Security’s inspector general, who previously said there was $71.8 billion in improper payments from fiscal years 2015 through 2022. That’s less than 1% of benefits paid out during that time period.\nMusk also said there were “20 million people who are definitely dead marked as alive in the Social Security database.” However, the leader of the agency has rejected claims about widespread payments to dead people.\n“These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,” said Lee Dudek, Social Security’s acting commissioner.\nThe interview with Fox Business was a reminder of Musk’s deep skepticism and even hostility toward the program, which provides monthly benefits to retirees and some children. Trump has promised to defend Social Security from cuts, but Musk has described it as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” and the Administration is shutting down some of the agency’s offices.\nMusk said Monday that federal entitlements are “a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters.” The allegation echoed the “great replacement” theory, which claims that politicians are trying to expand their power by reshaping the country’s racial demographics.\nThe interview was conducted in the White House complex by Larry Kudlow, who served as an economic adviser to Trump during his first term. During the conversation, Musk seemed to acknowledge the unusual nature of his role in the Administration.\n“Frankly, I can’t believe I’m here doing this,” Musk said. “It’s kind of bizarre.”\nMusk is the world’s richest person and still runs his private enterprises as he advises the President on ways to overhaul the federal government.\nHe also thanked Trump for his confidence, saying, “Without the President’s support, we couldn’t make any progress here.”\nTrump has publicly backed Musk and given him extraordinary influence over the federal government. However, the Republican President has indicated a shift in approach, saying that Musk's team would use a “scalpel” rather than a “hatchet.”\nRead More: Clinton and Gore’s Attempts at Government Reform Highlight the Challenges Ahead for DOGE\nMusk has not often spoken publicly since joining the administration, preferring instead to present a stream of consciousness on X, his social media platform. On Monday, he accused Democrats of attacking Tesla dealerships; bragged about X being “the top source for news on Earth;” and accused Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former fighter pilot and astronaut, of being a traitor for visiting Ukraine over the weekend.\nMusk's sitdown with Kudlow was his third interview since joining Trump's Administration, and he hasn't strayed from his ideological safe space. He previously did a joint interview with the President and Sean Hannity of Fox News, and he sat down with Joe Rogan, a podcaster who endorsed Trump last year.\nRepublicans have spent decades trying to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, and many have cheered Musk's work.\n“The American people are sick of the swamp. They’re sick of waste, fraud and abuse,” said Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, who leads the National Republican Congressional Committee. “For the first time ever, we finally have the tools to affect it. So I think the voters are going to reward us.”\nBut there are signs of backlash and skepticism. Some Republicans have even boasted of blocking budget cuts.\nOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole issued a statement saying three federal offices in his state—the National Weather Center in Norman, the Social Security Administration Office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services Office in Oklahoma City—would stay open.\n“I am thrilled to announce that common sense has prevailed,” he said. Cole added that “all three of these places provide vital and valuable services to Oklahomans and I am so proud to have advocated for them.”\nAbout half of Americans said it’s “a bad thing” that Trump has given Musk a prominent role in his Administration, according to a mid-February CNN/SSRS poll. Only a third saw it as “a good thing.”\nAnother mid-February survey by The Washington Post and Ipsos found that Americans were divided on whether Musk is mainly cutting wasteful spending or necessary programs, with about a third falling into each camp. Another quarter said they weren’t sure.\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Some of the more severe incidents have involved Molotov cocktails or gunfire at Tesla locations, as well as graffiti. Police have made multiple arrests and are continuing to investigate incidents that could be deemed as arson.\nTesla owners have also been targeted, with some being doxxed on a website last week and others reporting an uptick in road rage and harassment.\nMusk has commented on the rise in attacks against Tesla, and told vandals to \"stop being psycho\" during a surprise all-hands Tesla meeting at its Texas Gigafactory last week. Musk also called the attacks \"deeply wrong\" in a social media post.\nPresident Donald Trump has also commented on the recent incidents occurring at Tesla showrooms and dealerships. In addition to buying his own Tesla Model S and a Cybertruck for his grandaughter in a show of solidarity with the company, Trump has said that those found responsible for \"sabotaging Teslas\" could face up to 20 years in prison.\nTrump has said attacks against Tesla would be labeled as \"domestic terrorism,\" and the DOJ has echoed that sentiment and said that vandalism incidents have been \"nothing short\" of that.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a comment from Business Insider.\nDo you work at a Tesla dealership?

            "full_content": "A 41-year-old from Oregon was arraigned in federal court Wednesday for allegedly “possessing” Molotov cocktails near a Tesla dealership in Salem, Oregon, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice. The charges come as Americans across the country have been protesting at Tesla dealerships to express their disapproval of Elon Musk and the way he’s been dismantling the U.S. federal government in an oligarchic coup.\nAdam Matthew Lansky has been charged with “illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device,” according to the DOJ, after allegedly “throwing Molotov cocktails” at a Tesla dealership in Salem on Jan. 20, the same day as President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Another incident at the dealership occurred on Feb. 19, when bullets were allegedly fired into a building and vehicle on the property, according to Salem Police.\nBoth incidents have been tied to Lansky, though images captured by surveillance cameras and released to local news stations simply show a masked figure dressed in black. There are no clear indications of the identity of the person, but the DOJ press release claims a vehicle belonging to Lanksy was captured on surveillance video by a patrol car near the dealership. Police have yet to release that footage, as far as Gizmodo can tell. Lanksy was arrested Tuesday without incident, according to the DOJ.\nThe charges against Lansky come as vandalism of Tesla dealerships has risen across not just the U.S. but around the world in response to billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The wealthy oligarch has been destroying the federal government with his pseudo-government agency known as DOGE, and while just about everything he’s doing is illegal, nobody is stopping him. President Donald Trump has tasked Musk with getting rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse,” but Musk has so far made it pretty clear that he’s just getting rid of government programs he doesn’t like. Musk has yet to present a single piece of evidence showing “fraud” in anything he’s cut across the government.\nAnd with no real avenue to express their discontent, given the weakness of Democrats to present any kind of tangible opposition, average Americans are making Tesla’s brand toxic. A man in Massachusetts was arrested Wednesday for “vandalism” for allegedly putting stickers depicting Musk’s Nazi-like salute on Tesla cars. Tesla charging stations in Northern California were recently tagged with swastikas and a woman was recently charged in Colorado for tagging a Tesla dealership with words like “Nazi.”\nTesla cars on the street are frequently being targeted, with people often leaving flyers imploring the drivers to sell their vehicles. And there are countless reports of Tesla Cybertrucks getting egged and pelted with Mardi Gras beads, as just some recent examples.\n“Driving a Tesla went from a cool thing to do to not a cool thing pretty quickly,” one Tesla owner told KPTV news.\nThe Tesla Takeover movement is organizing protests against Musk at Tesla dealerships across the U.S., with a centralized webpage that allows anyone to search for a protest near them. And Tesla sales in Europe have plummeted as Musk tries to influence the political landscape beyond America’s shores.\nSome Tesla drivers have put bumper stickers on their vehicles expressing their disgust with Musk and his extremist views, while some people are going so far as to swap out the badges entirely, opting to disguise their Teslas with Toyota and Mazda emblems. But pretending that you don’t own a Tesla by changing the logo is just a temporary fix to a social stigma that’s likely to hang around for some time.\nMusk’s destruction of the federal government is already harming the U.S. economy, with the jobs report on Thursday showing layoffs spiked to their highest level since Feb. 2020. Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase according to CBS News, and those figures don’t even capture the full extent of the damage yet, according to analysts.\n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          You have to laugh to keep from crying.\n        \n\n          World Liberty Financial is launching USD1 backed by U.S. treasuries and dollar deposits.\n        \n\n          The military wants to use rockets to move supplies around the world âlightning fast.â\n        \n\n          Howard Lutnick told staff to increase use of satellite internet, specifically naming Starlink, according to a new FT report.\n        \n\n          It's unclear whether the incident represents a breach of the Espionage Act.\n        \n\n          Musk is accused of securities law violations related to his purchase of Twitter.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

It used a Tesla to draw a slogan reading \"Don't buy a Tesla\" on a beach in Wales and projected videos of Musk's controversial gesture at a Trump rally in late January on Tesla's factory in Berlin.\nAnother activist group called Everyone Hates Elon has been running paid-for advertisements on bus stops in London this month.\nFollowing last week's spate of vandalism against Elon Musk's EV company, President Donald Trump vowed to label such attacks as domestic terrorism.\nThe unrest comes as Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts have sparked a backlash against his EV maker.\nSome Tesla owners have vowed to sell their cars, some citing Musk's work directing DOGE's layoffs, his gesture at the Trump rally, and fear of being harassed.\nTech CEO Mitchell Feldman, a Tesla Model Y owner, told BI he was confronted in a parking lot while on his way to a concert in London.\nTesla stock has more than halved in about three months, while JPMorgan analysts slashed their price target to $135 last week.\nShares could fall even further as investors assess the impact of Chinese EV maker BYD's new rapid charging technology, Tesla sales slowing worldwide, and Musk's distraction with DOGE.\nWhile remaining the world's richest person, Musk's net worth has fallen by $130 billion this year to $303 billion at Tuesday's close following the slide in Tesla stock."

Tesla shares prices fell by half a percentage point after trading hours.\nIn the Friday note, Ives said he believed Tesla's future remained bright thanks to its investments in autonomous vehicles, AI and robotics — but warned that challenges remain.\n\"Musk needs to lead Tesla through this very turbulent period and show employees and investors the other side of this dark brand crisis tornado,\" wrote Ives.\n\"We are not asking Musk to give up his DOGE initiative ... instead we and many top investors are asking for balance as Tesla CEO and DOGE in this key period for Tesla.\"\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

In Oregon, the police are investigating after a dealership in a Portland suburb was hit with gunfire for the second time in a week.\nIn China, meanwhile, sales of Teslas manufactured in the country fell by 49% in February, according to industry data, as local EV rivals such as BYD continue to put the US automaker under serious pressure.\nTesla's share price has dropped by more than 50% since mid-December, with investors expressing concern over the worrying sales figures and the amount of time Musk is spending working on DOGE.\nTesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

One photo showed Kardashian posing in the bed of a Cybertruck, while another featured her cuddling with a Tesla robot near the beach.\nKardashian shared a slideshow of the photos, taken by Steven Klein, with her 357 million Instagram followers on Friday. Some Instagram users criticized the post due to Tesla's newfound association with the Trump administration.\nA post shared by Perfect Magazine said the photos were snapped in Malibu, California, last November. It's been four months since then, and a lot has happened.\nMusk, Tesla's CEO, has become the target of criticism for his work with the White House DOGE Office, which is tasked with slashing the federal budget. DOGE has sought to reduce the federal workforce and cut numerous departments and agencies, including NASA, USAID, and Veteran's Affairs. \nMusk also faced ire from politicians in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, who have britsled at his attempts to influence European politics.\nIn response, Tesla sales are down in several global markets and the company's stock price has cratered. Critics have staged protests against Musk, and some Tesla owners — including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly — have sold their vehicles.\nAmid reports of Tesla's struggles, Trump hosted an event at the White House last week where he showed off a Tesla car. Representatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\nKardashian told The Free Press in a 2021 interview that her political ideology is a mix of liberal and conservative. \"I believe in the rights that the Democrats want, but I believe in the taxes that the Republicans want,\" she said.\nKardashian has embraced criminal justice reform over the last decade, leading her to meet with Trump at the White House in 2018, 2019, and 2020. She also visited the White House during former President Joe Biden's administration in 2024 to meet Vice President Kamala Harris."

            "full_content": "Tesla has warned the Trump administration that it could bear the cost of the president's attempts to impose so-called retaliatory tariffs on US trade partners.\nIn an unsigned letter uploaded to a regulatory docket on Tuesday, the automaker said a trade war could increase costs to manufacture its vehicles and lead other countries to slap tariffs on Tesla vehicles made in Austin or electronic equipment it makes in states such as California and Nevada.\n\"Past US special tariff actions have thus increased costs to Tesla for vehicles manufactured in the United States, and increased costs for those same vehicles when exported from the United States, resulting in less competitive international marketplace for US manufacturers,\" the company wrote.\nElon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has been named a \"special government employee\" and is closely associated with President Donald Trump's drive to shrink and automate the federal government. The letter underscores how his political interests and his business interests could diverge.\nTesla's share price has fallen by nearly half since its December peak. Musk said earlier in the week he was having a tough time running his businesses because of his involvement with the White House DOGE office.\n\"Tesla supports a robust and thorough process to gather information to ensure appropriate actions are taken to address unfair trade practices and which, in the process, do not inadvertently harm US companies,\" said the letter, which was previously reported by the Financial Times.\nThe fact that the letter wasn't signed may be unusual, but isn't unprecedented for Tesla, which has previously submitted comments to the IRS without a signature at the bottom. Letters it has submitted to other agencies have included signatures.\nTesla, Musk, and the White House didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\nThe letter was uploaded to a public comment portal for the US Trade Representative on Tuesday by an in-house lawyer at Tesla. It's embedded below.\nThe letter was sent on the same day Trump invited Musk and a lineup of Teslas to the South Lawn of the White House for a publicity event. Trump said he'd be buying a Tesla to show his support for Musk and his company after acts of dealership vandalism.\nThe on-and-off threats of tariffs on Canada and Mexico could deal huge blows to America's largest automakers.\nBarclays analysts wrote in a March 5 note that a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico could wipe out profits for Ford, GM, and Stellantis, assuming no price increase or adjustment in production plans.\n\"If you look at the tariffs, let's be real honest, long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border would blow a hole in the US industry that we have never seen,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February.\nTesla also would feel the effects, considering 20% to 25% of the components for its 2025 model year vehicles come from Mexico, according to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration filing.\n\"There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs,\" Tesla's chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said in an earnings call on January 29. \"Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any will have an impact on our business and profitability.\""

            "full_content": "Elon Musk and his many projects have had a rough couple of months, but SpaceX nailed an undisputable win for him on Tuesday.\nThe rocket company's Crew Dragon spaceship splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico, carrying two NASA astronauts who were stuck on the International Space Station for about nine months.\nSuni Williams and Butch Wilmore became international news after their Boeing spaceship glitched as it approached the ISS in June. NASA decided it was safer for them to fly SpaceX home. The change of plans meant they had to stay and serve a full shift with the next astronaut crew, turning their original weeklong mission into nine months.\nTheir safe return is a win for Musk after a series of high-profile setbacks, from exploding Starship rockets to a Tesla stock crash.\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment.\nWilliams' and Wilmore's return is a much-needed win for SpaceX and Musk, who is struggling recently.\nMusk himself said on Fox Business that he's had \"great difficulty\" running his companies since taking on the Department of Government Efficiency, which was created by an executive order by President Donald Trump and aims to slash federal spending.\nHe didn't elaborate, but that day Tesla's stock had dropped 15%, bringing Musk's net worth down $29 billion.\nTesla has also been the subject of a series of protests, boycott efforts, and vandalism incidents in recent months. The electric vehicle company's sales have plunged in multiple countries, including the US.\nThat all culminated in Trump promoting Tesla cars last week on the White House lawn, where he inspected and praised five of the company's vehicles and said he would buy one.\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" the president wrote on Truth Social ahead of the Tesla event.\nThen there's SpaceX. The company's up-and-coming Starship mega-rocket was making significant progress with each uncrewed test flight until this year, when two consecutive flights ended with premature explosions.\nThose flights are experimental. In early March, however, one of the company's routine Falcon 9 rocket launches encountered an unexpected issue: The rocket's booster, which normally lands itself on a droneship for reuse, instead caught fire and toppled over after landing.\nAll the while, Musk has been contending with criticisms and backlash against DOGE — from legal challenges to scrutiny of its hires.\nCorporate experts have told Business Insider that Musk is \"way overstretched\" since taking on DOGE and \"may have finally reached his tipping point.\"\nSpaceX has been scheduled to bring the two astronauts back since August, when NASA officials decided they weren't confident enough in Boeing's spaceship to return Williams and Wilmore.\nMusk started teeing their return up as a new victory in January, when he said on X that President Trump had asked SpaceX to bring them home \"as soon as possible.\"\nMusk has since said on Fox News that Williams and Wilmore were \"left up there for political reasons,\" which multiple astronauts have disputed. The day ahead of their return flight he shared a video of Wilmore saying he appreciated Musk and Trump.\nDespite the hubbub, this was a pretty routine flight for SpaceX. It was the 10th time the company's Crew Dragon vehicle has returned NASA astronaut crews to Earth in the last five years — in addition to five private Crew Dragon flights.\nHave a tip?

In January, the US EV giant said it sold 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a 1% drop from the 1.81 million it sold in 2023 — the first time its annual sales declined in over a decade.\nTesla's pivot toward autonomous driving is taking place amid Musk's concerted push to redefine the EV giant as an \"AI or robotics company.\"\n\"If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework, and if you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible,\" Musk told investors in April.\nIn January, Musk said at an earnings call that while he hoped Tesla would have unsupervised full-self-driving vehicles in most countries by the end of next year, that could be \"limited simply by regulatory issues.\""

            "full_content": "Admittedly, I've never been a car person. If it was up to me, I'd still be driving the 1979 Monte Carlo I learned to drive in. That behemoth had a red-faded-to-pink interior, and I could easily cram all my friends and our cheerleading gear into the back.\nBut alas, I married a car guy. If he sees a car's headlights or taillights from a block away, he can name the make, model, and current value on the Kelley Blue Book.\nHe'd been dreaming of a Tesla for years since he took a road trip in a friend's Model S. \"It's so fast and sleek. And there's so much storage because there's no engine,\" he crooned. As Teslas became more popular, it became like our family's version of the Slug Bug game. \"There's a Tesla!\" our sons would cry from the back of our Nissan Pathfinder.\nAs more electric vehicles entered the market, we decided to join the club. So, my husband did what he does best — research. After considering Rivians and Polestars, he landed on the Tesla Model Y.\nIt had a decent range and a great charging infrastructure. Most of our driving was done in the city, but we did take occasional road trips to visit family in Iowa or up north for a family vacation. It also had the needed storage capacity for our family of four, our dog, and luggage for a week away. When we took our first test drive, I also fell in love with the Model Y.\nThe Tesla came with a learning curve. On our first longer trip, my husband and I experienced a tense 30 miles because we didn't stop to charge when the car told us to. We did the math and figured we could make it to our destination. We did make it— after we turned off the air conditioning and radio and slowed to 40 mph on the interstate to save battery. Luckily, our marriage survived. Needless to say, we always stopped to charge after that.\nIt also took some practice with one-pedal driving, but I soon loved it. I also enjoyed the acceleration in my Model Y, resulting in my first speeding ticket since 1999. I'm sure the bright red color made me an easy target.\nWhile it was sometimes annoying to stop for a charge on a road trip, we got used to the slight inconvenience and used the time to go for a short walk, peruse strange convenience store wares, and play silly car games.\nWhen we saw the final insurance quote, we thought there had to be a mistake. But no — it really was going to cost almost as much as our monthly grocery bill.\nWe knew our insurance premiums would be high because we have two young adult son drivers, but we had no idea adding a Tesla would be sell-a-kidney expensive.\nElectric cars generally cost more to insure than gas vehicles, and Teslas have some of the highest premiums. With our current policy, the Tesla costs over $333 a month, while our gas-powered Audi costs half that.\nWe've since learned that Teslas are outrageously expensive to insure because they're costly to repair, and the company corners the market on parts. Because the repair process can take a long time, insurance companies are stuck footing the bill for longer-term rentals. We also learned that because Teslas drive so fast, their insurance risk rating is just below that of a performance vehicle.\nOf course, we've also had several conversations about the Musk controversy, but at the end of the day our pocketbook and family needs dictate the decision to sell our Tesla this spring.\nThese are all factors we had no idea we should consider before we made our purchase, but they are definitely on my husband's new list as he researches our next vehicle. Now we're in the market for a plug-in hybrid, as they are a fraction of the price to insure and offer many of the same environmental and cost benefits we enjoyed with our Tesla — especially since most of our driving is within a few miles of our city home.\nI'm still not a car person. So while my husband dives into research on plug-in hybrids, I'll be here, hoping our next car is just as easy to drive, is cheap to insure, and — if I'm really lucky — comes in a color that doesn't result in a speeding ticket. I may never get my Monte Carlo back, but at least I'll be driving something that won't require us to take out a second mortgage just for insurance."

It may go viral,\" she wrote.\nIf she were to monetize the event, Wilson estimated she could easily net more than Volvo paid her for the first car.\nMeanwhile, some Tesla owners who aren't in a financial position to sell — or demolish — their cars are buying up bumper stickers with phrases like \"Elon Killed My Resale Value\" and \"I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.\"\nSticker-maker Matthew Hiller told BI he's been selling as many as 500 stickers a day in recent weeks amid wider \"Tesla Takedown\" protests across the US.\nPolice are also investigating multiple instances of vandalism against Tesla dealerships and lot vehicles and, in some cases, have made arrests."

            "full_content": "Donald Trump is getting his hands on a brand-new Tesla, but which model is best for the leader of the free world?\nWith five Tesla models currently on the market, Trump had a number of considerations to make: like whether he wanted more headroom, more speed, or more controversy.\nA parade of shiny new Teslas pulled up to the White House on Tuesday, following Trump's announcement that he would be buying one of the EVs to support his right-hand-man Elon Musk's company.\nThe electric vehicle company has been struggling ever since Musk became the de-facto leader of DOGE — its stock has plummeted, protests have erupted at showrooms around the country, owners have been offloading their vehicles, and investors are worried.\nHere's what Tesla models Trump had to consider — and what he ultimately decided on.\nIf Trump wanted to save the most money, he would have chosen the Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUV.\nWith a starting price of around $42,000 and $46,000, respectively, the Model 3 and Model Y are Tesla's EVs for the masses — and a key part of Musk's plan to expand electric mobility globally.\nDespite being packed with advanced tech and capable of excellent performance, their position as entry-level models and minimalist interiors feels like an unlikely choice for the President's tastes.\nThough Trump has been working to save money for the federal government, as someone with an apartment modeled after the Palace of Versailles, he's not known for being particularly frugal with his own money.\nThe original Roadster may have been the first Tesla, but it was the Model S that put the EV maker on the map and solidified Musk's position as an innovator in the automotive industry.\nThe Model S is Tesla's performance flagship, a superlative that will certainly catch Trump's attention. In fact, two Model S vehicles were presented to Trump outside the White House on Tuesday.\nThe Model S's fastest variant, the \"plaid,\" has a top speed of 200 mph and can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds, making it one of the world's 10 fastest-accelerating production cars.\nThat's enough to make Trump the king of the dragstrip.\nThe Model S also offers its own kind of Secret Service — a security feature called \"Sentry Mode,\" which uses the car's external cameras to monitor and provide a live feed of outside threats to the vehicle.\nWith recent reports of Teslas being vandalized, this feature would help protect Trump's car out in public, though it is difficult to imagine a president's car ever being parked out on the street.\nAt the White House presentation of Teslas, Trump held in his hand a list of vehicle options that included a silver Model X for $112,490.\nAlthough the Model X is nearly a decade old now, it's still the most interesting and daring vehicle in Tesla's lineup, with a single-piece glass roof windshield and automatic falcon wing doors.\nIt's a vehicle Musk once called a \"work of art\" and the Fabergé egg of cars.\nOn the practical side, if Trump wanted the Tesla with the most headroom for himself and his tall family — Trump's height is listed at 6 foot 3 inches, and his son Barron is between 6 foot 7 and 9 inches — then the Model X would have been the way to go.\nWith all add-on features included, the four-door SUV Model X can cost over $116,000 (before tax breaks), making it the priciest Tesla on the market.\nAnd as a seven-seater vehicle, Trump and every member of his immediate family — Melania, Tiffany, Barron, Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric — would all fit into the car at once, though it would likely be a much tighter squeeze than the billionaire family is used to.\nAs the most expensive Tesla, the Model S may have swayed Trump the most, particularly if he wants to give his buddy's struggling company the biggest boost.\nTesla's boldly styled Cyberstruck was sure to, at the very least, grab Trump's attention.\nThe controversial Cybertruck — the subject of widespread ridicule on social media as well as in real-life attacks — would certainly have made the biggest statement as a show of support for Musk. And as Trump said in his Tuesday tweet, supporting Musk is his main goal in buying a Tesla.\nWhen all add-on features are included, the four-door Cybertruck in Cyberbeast mode can cost over $111,000.\nThe Cybertruck offers a bit more security than other Tesla models because of its tougher exterior and windows. Still, the EV isn't quite as tough or bulletproof as Musk has claimed. The Cybertruck's stainless steel paneling has been reported to withstand bullets from a handgun, but not from faster weapons. And its \"armor glass\" windows famously broke during an onstage demonstration at Cybertruck's launch.\nOne thing Trump may have considered here though is that he does already have a Cybertruck, which was given to him as a gift from conservative, high-profile streamer Adin Ross. And Trump's ultimate choice of Tesla shows he just might not have been ready for His and Hers Cybertrucks.\nTrump appears to have selected a red Model S Tesla sedan — the automaker's fastest option.\n\"The one I like is that one, and I want the same color,\" Trump said, pointing to a red Model S, according to NBC News.\nTrump told reporters at the event, parts of which were livestreamed on the White House's X account, that as the president he's not allowed to drive on regular roads. But he could likely drive around the White House complex, as Barack Obama once did with Jerry Seinfeld on \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.\" Trump said since he can't use the car himself, he'll keep it at the White House for staff to use."

            "full_content": "Tesla has lost so much value in such a short period of time that JPMorgan analysts said they couldn't think of another comparable moment in automotive history.\n\"We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" they wrote, adding that the closest example was when Japanese and Korean car brands lost sales amid \"diplomatic disputes\" with China in 2012 and 2017, respectively.\nThe JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that those historical cases were \"confined to a single market, whereas the decline in Tesla sales in 2025 is not specific to any one nation or geography.\"\nJPMorgan analysts cut their price target on Tesla by about 41% from $230.58 to $135, lowering guidance on vehicle deliveries for the first quarter of 2025 to about 355,000 — an 8% year-over-year decrease from the first quarter of 2024.\nFrom December to Wednesday after trading hours, Tesla lost nearly 49% of its market cap, seeing its peak value of $1.54 trillion from the end of last year fall to about $777 billion.\nThis steep drop has come as Tesla experiences a global decline in sales and branding issues stemming from its chief executive's politics.\nFor a moment, Elon Musk's big bet on Donald Trump seemed to pay off. Tesla was the only EV company to see its stock surge after the president's electoral victory in November. The underlying assumption appeared to be that Musk's company could benefit if the Tesla CEO had the ear of the new administration and guided the White House's efforts to slash government spending. \nNow, that assumption is being challenged in some analysts' latest guidance, which notes a possible headwind in demand because of Musk's work with the Trump administration.\n\"Mr. Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency has proven controversial domestically, and while as many members of the political right may be pleased as those on the left are displeased, the effect on Tesla sales seems nevertheless negative,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote.\nIn recent weeks, Tesla showrooms across the US have seen protests and a string of vandalism incidents. Trump has rushed to Tesla's defense and said he'd consider labeling the perpetrators domestic terrorists.\nOutside brand reputation, some analysts are also concerned that Musk's focus on political affairs is again distracting the CEO from his core businesses.\n\"After all, the simultaneous decline in both Tesla pricing and unit volume expectations did coincide with his takeover of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter,\" JPMorgan analysts pointed out.\nMorgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note on Monday that Tesla shares had fallen because of \"sales data, negative brand sentiment, and market de-grossing\" but that they still saw a buying opportunity for the company.\n\"Today, with the stock down 50%, our investor conversations are focused on management distraction, brand degradation, and lost auto sales,\" analysts said.\nA spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.\nDespite the company's losses, Tesla remains the most valuable car company in the world.\nSecond to Tesla is the legacy automaker Toyota, which has a $292 billion market cap.\nMorgan Stanley analysts noted several \"catalysts\" in the company's pipeline, including Tesla's robotaxi, expected to hit Austin roads later this summer, and another demonstration of Optimus, the humanoid robot anticipated before the end of the year.\nBut expectations for Tesla's delivery timelines may have to be tempered, given that the CEO has a history of missing his own deadlines."

Eighteen-wheelers refusing to let you merge.\nIt's not easy driving the most controversial vehicle in the world.\nBusiness Insider spoke to 10 Cybertruck owners about their recent experiences with the vehicle. While some of the owners said their interactions are mostly positive, others said they've seen a notable spike in harassment or a continuation of negative interactions they encountered long before the \"Tesla Takedown\" protests began.\nThe Cybertruck has sparked mixed reactions since its release more than a year ago, with some owners previously describing getting flipped off as a right of passage of sorts.\nBut, for some owners, hostility has become more frequent and extreme in recent weeks as anti-Elon Musk protests and Tesla boycott movements gain momentum in response to Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration and DOGE.\nSome of it has made headlines. There have been a number of vandalism incidents involving Molotov cocktails, suspected arson, and even gunshot damage at Tesla dealerships and charging stations, with some leading to arrests. Cybertruck owners have posted photos on social media showing graffiti on their trucks.\nAt the wheel of the vehicle most associated with Musk, the 10 Cybertruck drivers detailed some of the incidents they've encountered in recent months.\nOne Cybertruck owner who requested anonymity to speak freely told BI that his recent experiences have been \"unsettling and disheartening.\"\nThe longtime Tesla owner said he was recently washing his new Cybertruck in his driveway when a stranger drove by and opened the car door to shout offensive remarks before speeding off. In addition to being yelled at, he said he's also recently been flipped off and honked at. The owner said his recent experiences led him to write a letter to his congressman.\n\"No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle,\" the Cybertruck owner said.\nNone of the Cybertruck owners BI spoke to encountered the kind of lasting damage to their vehicles that has made headlines recently, like broken windows at a Mardi Gras parade. Still, several said they've seen strangers get too close for comfort.\nSteven Minnick, a Cybertruck owner from New Jersey, said he recently went skiing in Vermont and came back to drawings of genitalia on his vehicle and derogatory insults.\nWhile the drawings on the stainless steel washed off, Minnick said the crude drawing on his bumper was \"scratched into the plastic,\" and didn't come off after several washes. He said it's now almost gone after using chemicals and buffing pads to remove it.\n\"I was kind of shocked,\" Minnick said, adding that he counted about 12 middle fingers, a thumbs down, and an \"L,\" from people when driving through Vermont. He said he usually only gets flipped off once every couple of weeks in New Jersey.\nTommy Huynh, a Cybertruck owner, told BI that he's watched people on Sentry Mode flick the car with their finger when he's parked. He also said his Cybertruck got shot with a paintball gun in early January, although he said he hasn't noticed a particular increase in negative interactions since Trump's reelection.\nAfter seeing repeated instances of vandalism in the media and online, some owners have become uncomfortable with leaving their vehicles unattended. One Cybertruck owner from Pennsylvania told BI he recently went to an auto show and left his Cybertruck at home because he thought someone \"might do something\" to it.\nSolo Arnett recently got a Cybertruck and said he had an 18-wheeler truck refuse to let him merge when he was on the highway. Another Cybertruck owner said he's experienced two recent instances of people getting out at traffic lights and screaming at him to get out of the truck.\n\"The Cybertruck just seems to send people over the edge a bit,\" the owner, who asked to remain anonymous, told BI. \"It makes no sense, I'm not Elon!\"\nIn the months since Musk's endorsement of Trump and work with DOGE, some Tesla owners have decided to sell their vehicles due to the brand's close association with the company's CEO.\n\"Arrested Development\" and \"Ozark\" actor Jason Bateman, for example, said last year that he got rid of his Tesla after Musk's endorsement of President Donald Trump because he felt like he was \"driving around [with] a Trump sticker with that car.\"\nSome Tesla owners have purchased bumper stickers proclaiming \"I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.\"\nOther Cyberturck owners told BI that they've been taunted verbally or in social settings.\nJay O'Brien, a Cybertruck owner from Kansas City, said he hears people talking in parking lots as he walks to and from his truck. At a recent trivia night, he also said several players made jokes about the Cybertruck parked outside.\nO'Brien said most of the interactions are still \"more good than bad\" though, and that he found some of the jokes about Tesla funny.\nThe Pennsylvania Cybertruck owner said within a week of the new administration, he started to notice increased negative interactions. He said he feels like it's now become cool and socially acceptable to flip off Tesla owners.\nSeveral other owners told BI they haven't noticed a major difference in negativity since the election, and some said they've mainly seen it online.\nHuynh and Minnick said that, for the most part, they've experienced a continued level of negativity from before and after the election, and while Minnick's experience in Vermont caught him off guard, it was isolated to that trip.\nThe Pennsylvania Cybertruck owner also added that even though the negative interactions he's experienced have increased, people's reactions mostly remain positive, with children, in particular, expressing excitement at seeing the electric truck.\nFor some owners, the positive moments are a bright spot amid the challenges that can come with driving the EV.\nArnett recalled an exchange in the last week when a man approached his Cybertruck and asked for a video with it for his bedridden son, who the man said is a huge fan.\n\"I let him get in the truck and everything. It was a touching experience,\" Arnett said.\nAre you a Tesla owner who has recently experienced harassment or vandalism? We want to hear from you.

            "full_content": "Music legend will.i.am says he bet on Tesla before Elon Musk took the wheel — but turned down the chance to be one of Airbnb's early backers.\n\"I invested in Tesla in 2006, before Elon took over the company, and he's done great, taking it to where it is,\" he recently told Fortune. \"Hopefully, he can figure out a way to get it back to its glory.\"\nThe founder and CEO of FYI, whose real name is William Adams, stands to have made a fortune if he kept his stock. Tesla went public in June 2010 at $17 a share, or $1.13 adjusted for stock splits in 2020 and 2022.\nThe electric vehicle company's stock hit a record high of about $480 in December, representing a more than 420-fold increase from the IPO price.\nTesla shares closed at just under $249 on Friday, meaning an investor who bought in at the IPO price and held until now has made more than 200 times their money. Earlier buyers would have paid less for their shares, paving the way for an even greater return if they retained their stake.\nThe singer was asked on the \"Drinks Champs\" podcast last year to pick his favorite between Musk and Steve Jobs, the Apple cofounder.\n\"Damn, both of those cats is why my life is nice,\" will.i.am replied, noting he was part of the team that sold Beats by Dre to Apple for $3 billion in 2014. \"You're talking about two companies that … changed my life — so I say both.\"\nThe rapper and producer recently told Channel 4 that Tesla has \"had its valleys and its highs\" and applauded Musk for having \"saved it out of bankruptcy in the past.\"\nHe also hailed Musk as a dreamer and one of the \"heroes of this era\" while sitting next to the Tesla and SpaceX chief during a 2012 discussion hosted by Singularity University's executive program.\nAnother entertainment legend, Morgan Freeman, has also said he owns Tesla stock and has spoken highly of Musk. \"He's, you know, what he's done, nobody else has ever done,\" the movie star said in 2016. \"He's landed a rocket ship so it's reusable — you know what a feat that is?\"\nA representative for will.i.am declined to confirm whether he still owned Tesla shares, telling Business Insider he \"doesn't publicly discuss his holdings at this level of detail.\"\nThe music superstar — who shot to fame with the Black Eyed Peas and later became a judge on \"The Voice UK\" — told Fortune his previous bets include Pinterest, Dropbox, OpenAI, and Anthropic, along with another company that Musk now owns.\n\"I invested in Twitter early on. When Jack [Dorsey] left, I sold it. Made good there,\" will.i.am said.\nThe \"I Gotta Feeling\" and \"Boom Boom Pow\" singer also said Airbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky invited him to invest up to $200,000 in an early fundraising round.\nAfter will.i.am learned the home-sharing platform offered neither a concierge nor room service to guests, he rejected the invitation. He explained that frequently traveling and staying in hotels meant he'd been \"pampered by the best,\" leading him to judge Airbnb by luxury hospitality standards.\nPassing was the \"wrong decision\" and a \"bad one,\" he said at a recent SXSW event, per an Instagram video. Airbnb went public in December 2020 and is now valued at about $80 billion, meaning even a 0.1% stake would be worth roughly $80 million.\n\"Ballin', I would have been,\" will.i.am quipped. \"Now, I'm like bawlin'.\"\nAxel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb."

Those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in an X post."

            "full_content": "A photo from a White House event Tuesday captured President Donald Trump with a list of prices for Teslas that were parked on the south lawn of the White House.\nPrior to the event, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he wanted to buy one of the company's electric vehicles as a show of support for Elon Musk. At a media event Tuesday afternoon, Trump walked up to a red Model S.\n\"That's beautiful,\" he said, later adding that he would write a check for the car. The Model S retails for about $80,000.\nTrump also said he would gift his 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai, a Cybertruck — another Tesla vehicle with a starting price of nearly $80,000.\nAttached to a copy of Trump's speech was a handwritten note that included prices for the cars and read like a sales pitch.\nA photographer captured an image of the note, which read in part, \"Teslas can be purchased as low as $299/month or $35K.\"\nWhile there are tax incentives for those looking to buy electric vehicles under the Inflation Reduction Act, it's unclear whether Trump would qualify for them.\nUnder US law, presidents make $400,000 a year —far above the $300,000 maximum income cap for the EV tax credit. Back in 2016, Trump said he would be taking only a $1 salary during his first term. Trump has not said whether he'll be doing so for his second term.\nThe White House didn't respond to a request for comment about the list.\nTrump has increasingly stepped up his support for Tesla as a show of support to Musk, who is closely tied with the White House's new DOGE office, amid growing protests against the EV company.\nProtesters across the US and in Europe have demonstrated against Tesla, denouncing Musk's politics, while others vandalized local Tesla showrooms.\nThe company's stock has also taken a beating in recent months amid declining global sales and concerns that its leader is spending too much time focused on his White House role rather than his companies.\nTesla stock is down over 50% from its record highs in mid-December. Shares in the company closed Tuesday at $230.58.\nTrump said at the Tuesday White House event that he was going to buy a Tesla \"because, No. 1, it's a great product, as good as it gets, and No. 2,\" he said, pointing to Musk, \"because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, and I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people.\"\nThe president said that he wouldn't be allowed to actually drive the vehicle and \"hasn't driven a car in a very long time\" but that staff at the White House would be able to.\nTrump hasn't always been a fan of electric cars. This past summer, while speaking in Chicago at the National Association of Black Journalists, he said he was \"against everybody having an electric car,\" despite Musk's endorsement."

            "full_content": "Tesla has started rolling out driving-assistance features to some cars in China that are similar to the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in the US, according to a software update log.\nTesla said the new features allow Tesla owners in China to use driver-assist features on controlled-access and city roads. These include guiding vehicles to exit ramps and intersections, recognizing traffic signals, making turns, and managing lane changes and speed adjustments.\nIt does not incorporate all of Tesla's FSD features, including autonomously navigating complex urban environments such as parking lots. Tesla is not branding it as Full Self-Driving.\n\"For some features, the time of implementation and results may vary based on the vehicle's model and configuration,\" the company said, adding that the range of models will be gradually expanded.\nBloomberg first reported Tesla's planned deployment of FSD features in China.\nThe move comes after BYD, Tesla's biggest rival in China, announced earlier this month that it would equip nearly all its models with advanced self-driving tech at no extra cost, and other rivals followed suit.\nIn contrast, Tesla owners in China have had to pay about $8,800 extra for self-driving features — a sum nearly as high as the cost of BYD's cheapest model.\nBYD has racing ahead in China's fiercely competitive EV market. In January it sold sold nearly twice as many EVs as Tesla, with the US carmaker's sales down 11% compared with the same month in 2024.\nBYD sold a record 66,000 vehicles outside China in January, indicating that a push to expand outside its home market is starting to pay off.\nLast month, BYD overtook Toyota to become Singapore's best-selling car brand and also beat Tesla in the UK for the first time.\nOther Chinese brands such as NIO, XPeng, MG, and ORA are also notching up higher sales of their affordable electric and hybrid vehicles outside China amid intense competition in the domestic market."

            "full_content": "This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 53-year-old Mitchell Feldman, the CEO of Jam 7, an AI-powered marketing platform, from the UK. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\nI bought a Tesla Model Y in 2022.\nMy previous car — a convertible — looked amazing, but as a gadget enthusiast, I felt I was missing out on technology and the user experience. There was no touchscreen, integration with my phone, or smart driving.\nI was drawn to a Tesla because it had all the things I wanted. It was easy to use and environmentally friendly. I liked the idea of never having to go to a gas station again. The safety features, like assisted driving and situational awareness, also drew me.\nI spent around £65,000 on my Model Y, and it's performed over and above my expectations. However, last week, I was confronted by a man who was mocking my Tesla. I've also been seeing negative sentiment toward Elon Musk online.\nThe sentiments have made me concerned about the resale value of my Tesla, but I still like the car and plan to buy another Tesla soon.\nSince I've had my Tesla, most people who've gotten into my car easily draw the connection between my love of technology and the car.\nLast week, I experienced the first negative reaction to my Tesla. I went to a concert in London, and while I was in the parking lot, I saw a guy with his wife and daughter pointing at my car and laughing.\nThe guy came up to me in a very confrontational way and said, \"Do you support Elon Musk, then, driving a Tesla?\"\nI was quite aghast. I felt quite violated by the question and didn't know what to say.\nI've always admired Elon Musk because I think that a lot of the technology he creates is for betterment. I hadn't considered the impact his work at DOGE was having on the US government; as someone based in the UK, I'm somewhat removed from what's happening. I think Trump has brought in someone who will look at the situation through the lens of a CEO.\nBut it made me realize how the perception of Musk impacts his brands — which led me to post about the incident on LinkedIn.\nThe post attracted a lot of attention. There was a lot of polarization between people in the comments; many were negative. Some people were astounded that I said I admired Musk and that I'd damaged my personal brand because of the post.\nMy current business specializes in building AI for marketing purposes, but I've worked in technology for 30 years and have built and sold several technology businesses.\nI respect Elon Musk and like that his businesses are data-driven, whether it's Neuralink, SpaceX, or Tesla. Tesla is a pioneer company. Musk is setting new standards for the industry.\nEveryone is allowed an opinion, but I'm proud of the fact that I don't conform to the crowd and choose my personal preferences over listening to what everyone else says.\nI'm aware that some Tesla owners are trying to distance themselves from the brand. I've seen a trend where people are buying bumper stickers for their Teslas that say things like, \"I bought this before Musk went crazy.\"\nThis turn of events has made me think, but it hasn't put me off from buying another Tesla. I'm waiting for the new Model Y to arrive in the UK, and then I'll place my order.\nMaybe I'll make more of a loss than I thought when I try to get rid of my old Tesla, but that doesn't bother me.\nBeing in a vehicle that I feel will save my life in an accident is more important to me than the personality or brand of Elon Musk.\nI bought the car for the experience, safety, and technology, and that hasn't changed."

People are going to be dreaming of today, and Jesse Watters, and thinking, 'Gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk's stock,'\" Lutnick added.\nMusk initially backed Lutnick as President Donald Trump's treasury secretary pick. Musk wrote in an X post in November that Lutnick \"will actually enact change\" instead of Trump's eventual choice, Scott Bessent, whom Musk called the \"business-as-usual\" option.\nBefore entering government, Lutnick was the chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The brokerage and investment bank, per an SEC filing in February, owns Tesla shares. Lutnick agreed to divest his business interests in the bank following his confirmation as commerce secretary.\nTesla's stock price has fallen by over 50% from its record highs. The company's shares closed at about $235 on Wednesday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December.\nThe decline in Tesla stock comes as the company grapples with weakening sales and the controversy surrounding Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Scores of Musk protesters have descended upon Tesla showrooms nationwide in recent weeks.\n\"So you're calling the bottom? This is it?\" Watters asked Lutnick about Tesla's stock on Wednesday.\n\"If today's the bottom or not, I can tell you what — Elon Musk is probably the best person to bet on,\" Lutnick said.\nTesla and the Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\nLutnick isn't the only government official who has voiced his support for Musk and Tesla.\nTrump recently held a media event at the White House where he purchased a Model S. Multiple Tesla vehicles were parked on the south lawn of the White House during the event on March 11.\nTrump wrote in a Truth Social post ahead of the event that his purchase was a \"show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\"\nOn Tuesday, Musk blamed the political left for the protests and vandalism at Tesla dealerships.\n\"It's really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left,\" Musk told Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Tuesday.\n\"Tesla is a peaceful company. We have never done anything harmful. I have never done anything harmful, only done productive things,\" Musk said."

            "full_content": "Tesla's most bullish Wall Street analyst said Elon Musk's company is in a \"crisis,\" and only its CEO can fix it.\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who has consistently been optimistic about Tesla's long-term outlook, wrote in a joint note on Wednesday that the EV maker is facing a \"defining chapter\" in its trajectory, and the outcome will depend on Musk.\n\"Lets call it like it is: Tesla is going through a crisis and there is one person who can fix it....Musk,\" Ives wrote in his memo.\nFor nearly nine weeks, Tesla has been on a historic decline, with its stock sitting 53% below its all-time high from mid-December. The company is battered by increasing competition in China, sagging global vehicle sales, and a reputation problem that investors worry is being caused by a distracted CEO.\n\"If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol....and this is a bad thing,\" Ives wrote on Wednesday.\nIves added in his note that Tesla is at a crossroads and Musk needs to do two things if he wants to \"end this crisis and make sure it does not snowball into a much more black swan event for the Tesla brand over the coming years.\"\nFirstly, Ives said that Musk needs to make a statement, either before or during Tesla's first quarterly earnings call in early May, on how he will manage his roles at Tesla and the White House DOGE office.\n\"Investors need to see Musk take a step back and balance his DOGE and Tesla CEO roles,\" Ives said.\nIf Musk does take a step back, the \"heat\" around his DOGE work will \"start to dissipate,\" Ives said. That \"will leave a scar for Tesla\" but won't amount to \"permanent brand damage,\" Ives added.\nSecondly, Ives said that Musk must provide a \"roadmap and timing for the new lower cost vehicles\" Tesla is releasing this year, and more guidance on the \"unsupervised FSD roll-out in Austin in June.\"\nIves added that investors need to hear from Musk, particularly given \"the Model Y refresh, inventory issues, and a host of demand issues with Musk brand damage a worry.\"\nTesla and Ives did not respond to requests for comment from BI.\nMusk pitched his idea of a government efficiency commission to President Donald Trump during a livestream on X in August, and said he would be \"happy to help out\" with slashing federal spending.\nTo be sure, Musk's relationship with Trump was initially viewed as a positive development for his businesses.\nMusk's net worth grew by up as much as $224 billion following Trump's election victory in November, per Bloomberg's estimates. But his net worth has since fallen by around $122 billion this year mainly due to a decline in Tesla's stock prices.\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares reached a peak closing price of $479. The company's shares closed at about $235 on Wednesday.\nSome investors are less concerned than Ives.\nTsai Capital's president and chief investment officer, Christopher Tsai, told Business Insider this week that it is important to distinguish between Musk's work with DOGE, and his involvement with the US government.\n\"Elon being involved in the government is allowing him to shape policy,\" Tsai said, adding that the \"negative market sentiment\" over Musk and DOGE will \"disappear at some point.\""

            "full_content": "Tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk has visited the Pentagon for briefings that have sparked debate after US media reported that he would be given an overview of American plans in the event of war with China.\nPresident Donald Trump denied the reports, saying \"China will not even be mentioned or discussed\".\nMusk himself called for the prosecution of officials he said had leaked \"maliciously false information\" to the New York Times, which first reported the story.\nBut the Pentagon visit represented an unusual level of access for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose companies hold billions of dollars in federal defence contracts.\nAs Musk departed the defence secretary's office around 10:21 local time (14:21 GMT) on Friday, reporters asked him about the meeting. \n\"It's always a great meeting. I've been here before, you know,\" he said before departing the Pentagon.\nThe public back-and-forth about the meeting follows a New York Times report that Musk would learn about the China war plan during his Pentagon visit. \nBut NBC News and Politico later reported the Pentagon meeting would involve unclassified information. \nAn unnamed US official told Reuters that the briefing would be an overview of several topics that included China. \nTrump said the New York Times reported \"incorrectly, that Elon Musk is going to the Pentagon tomorrow to be briefed on any potential 'war with China.' How ridiculous? China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies. Anyway, the story is completely untrue!!!\"\nUS Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also denied the New York Times report, saying in a post on X \"this is NOT a meeting about 'top secret China war plans.' It's an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production\".\nAsked by reporters about the meeting on Friday, Trump said: \"We don't want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you if we did, we're very well equipped to handle it. But I don't want to show [the plan] to anybody.\" \nHe nodded to concerns about  Musk's visit to the Pentagon, which is drawing scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest, saying \"you wouldn't show it to a businessman\". \n\"Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that,\" Trump said.\nTesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, has two facilities in Shanghai, China.  Starlink and SpaceX, two of Musk's companies, also have contracts with the Pentagon. \nSince Trump returned to the White House, Musk, as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has been leading a cost-cutting task force to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.\nPresident Trump also defends his national security team after a reporter was added to their message thread.\nAs top US officials describe Europe as \"freeloaders\", European leaders and policy-makers are said to be \"sick to the stomach\".\nThe move comes days after US officials met with the Taliban government to secure the release of an American tourist.\nSome of the key reactions to reports that a journalist was inadvertently added to a chat with high-level Trump officials discussing air strikes in Yemen.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

            "full_content": "China is frequently a target of criticism over allegations that it does not innovate but instead exfiltrates intellectual property developed abroad and wins by undercutting rivals on price. Now that the country has arguably leapfrogged America in electrical vehicle technology, it is starting to see the value in protecting domestic business in the free market.\nAccording to the Financial Times, authorities in China have delayed approval of a new BYD factory in Mexico over concerns that its electric vehicle technology will be lifted over the southern border.\nIt is very much a “Spiderman pointing at Spiderman” type situation. From the article:\nDomestic automakers require approval from Chinaâs commerce ministry to manufacture overseas and it has yet to give approval, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nAuthorities feared Mexico would gain unrestricted access to BYDâs advanced technology and knowhow, they said, even possibly allowing US access to it. âThe commerce ministryâs biggest concern is Mexicoâs proximity to the US,â said one of the people.\nBYD has quickly trounced Tesla in the electric vehicle market, selling 3.4 million vehicles in 2024 compared to Tesla’s 1.7 million, and is continuing to grow at a rapid pace while Elon Musk’s company faces declining sales globally.\nThe Chinese company, which started in 1995 supplying batteries to other electronics manufacturers, has released a range of affordable electric cars and this week announced new battery technology that can charge a vehicle in just five minutes. Its self-driving system, called “God’s Eye,” will also be made available for free across its entire lineup in the near future. Maybe that is technology Musk would like to get his hands on.\nWhile there exists substantial evidence that Chinese companies steal intellectual propertyâstories of Chinese engineers fleeing America with thumb drives of confidential documents aboundâit is also true that China is masterful at executing when the one-party authoritarian nation decides to prioritize an industry. It is hard to argue with the success of BYD, and its cars have received strong reviews.\nThe growth of BYD has been fueled by substantial government support in China, and a large domestic market to sell its cars into. BYD has been expanding globally, however, which is unusual. The company sold 40,000 vehicles in Mexico last year and has become a major player in Brazil and Europe as well. Factories could help China further develop soft power abroad similar to the way its Belt and Road project has seen the country support infrastructure development in other countries.\nThe U.S. meanwhile is falling behind in the global automotive industry where it once dominated, as Musk supports cutbacks on EV subsidies just as the industry was really starting to take off. Some critics have speculated that Musk’s real intention is to hamper rivals like GM and Ford, who still have yet to reach profitability in their EV businesses while Tesla has managed to become profitable on a per-unit basis. Either way, China is taking a clear lead in EVs domestically and abroad while the United States focuses on more dubious priorities, namely crypto and AI.\nOn the current trajectory, ten years from now Americans traveling abroad are going to look at Chinese electric cars like Boris Yeltsin looked at American grocery stores\nBYD has some challenges abroad, as the Financial Times noted. BYD has been subject to accusations of slave labor conditions in its international factories, for one. And President Trump is still able to flex American power by threatening countries including Mexico that allow Chinese players to grow. BYD committed in 2024 to building a factory in Mexico but is now less committed as the government there seeks to placate the Trump administration.\nTariffs are not as much of an issue as BYD does not sell into the United States due to government restrictions here, though if you want to get an electric vehicle at a rock bottom price, you might be able to drive over the border and pick up a BYD Dolphin Mini Plus. The car has an estimated driving range of 252 miles and retails for $23,000âessentially the exact type of vehicle many Tesla fans hoped it would make.\n\nbydChinaElectric carsTESLA \n\r\n          Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r\n        \n\r\n          News from the future, delivered to your present.\r\n        \n\r\n      Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r\n    \n\n          In this day and age, technology like automated license plate readers make it trivial to hunt down vandals.\n        \n\n          The manufacturer is recalling 46,000 of the vehicles due to a faulty exterior panel, marking the eighth time it's been recalled.\n        \n\n          Elon Musk told Fox News \"they basically want to kill me\" when discussing opposition to Tesla.\n        \n\n          The Chinese automaker says it will start selling vehicles with the new battery system starting next month.\n        \n\n          As stock slumps and Americans turn against the automaker, its owners are paying higher insurance premiums.\n        \n\n          Turns out LiDAR might have some benefits.\n        \nWe may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.\nÂ©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

            "full_content": "Tesla has ramped up its autonomous testing capabilities in California.\nIn December, the electric-car maker registered 224 in-house test drivers and 104 vehicles in the state for an autonomous testing permit, according to public records viewed by Business Insider.\nIt's an uptick from 2022, the last time Tesla filed for the permit. That year, it registered 59 drivers and 14 vehicles.\nThe surge in test drivers comes as the clock ticks for the company to fulfill Elon Musk's promise of bringing a Robotaxi to market within the year. Tesla's stock has continued to drop, and is down more than 40% year-to-date over lackluster sales numbers and Musk's polarizing role in the US government, after hitting an all-time high after Donald Trump's election victory.\nThe permit, first granted in 2015, allows the carmaker to conduct what's known as level 3 testing, which lets the autonomous driving software assume a greater degree of control over the vehicle. It still requires a licensed driver to monitor the vehicle and take over when needed, but testing it is one of the first steps Tesla must take to roll out its self-driving technology in the state.\nObtaining the permit doesn't necessarily mean Tesla will use it. Companies are required to report usage — measured by mileage and the number of times human test drivers take control of the vehicles — every year.\nTesla hasn't reported using the permit since 2019. The company has long maintained that it conducts level 2 testing, focused on unreleased versions of the driver-assist software already available in customers' cars.\nTesla submitted paperwork for the registrations to the California Department of Motor Vehicles in December. The registrations, which cost about $8,700 in total, are in effect for 2025 and 2026. The permit can be renewed every two years.\nIn November, after some test drivers told Business Insider they pushed Tesla's self-driving software to its limit, the California DMV asked Tesla whether its testing aligned with what the state permit allows, public records show.\nIn an emailed response to the DMV, Tesla's director of field reliability said the company was testing driver-assist software similar to what Tesla customers already have in their vehicles. Test drivers underwent \"rigorous\" training, per the email, including when to intervene in \"unsafe\" situations and when to avoid taking over during \"safe but undesired vehicle behaviors\" like missing a turn or frequently changing lanes.\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nMusk has said the carmaker plans to roll out robotaxis in some California cities by the end of the year. Bloomberg reported in February that the company had filed for a permit with the California Public Utilities Commission, which would allow the carmaker to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service.\nThe Tesla CEO has repeatedly emphasized that much of Tesla's value revolves around its self-driving technology. Tesla's stock has plummeted in recent weeks, and JP Morgan analysts said in a note to investors on Wednesday that the company had lost so much value since Musk took on his advisory role in government that they couldn't find another comparable drop in automotive history.\nEven Tesla bull Dan Ives sounded an alarm: The analyst wrote on Tuesday that Tesla and Musk are facing a \"moment of truth\" as investors grow weary of Musk's focus on DOGE.\nTesla's dropping value puts pressure on the company's Robotaxi efforts. Ives said he puts \"90%\" of Tesla's value over the next few years on the company's autonomous technology and humanoid robot. Tesla has yet to file for a permit that would allow it to test the vehicle without a safety driver — a milestone that self-driving car startups Waymo and Zoox hit in 2020 and 2023, respectively.\nThe company has been on a hiring spree for test drivers across the country. In February, it hosted hiring events in Las Vegas and Dallas, according to a recruiter's post on X. It also posted openings for test drivers in several towns in Texas, Nevada, and California.\nIn Austin, Tesla has met with members of the city's autonomous vehicle taskforce and discussed robotaxi training for local emergency responders, according to emails viewed by Business Insider. Unlike California, Texas has few regulations around autonomous driving; vehicles are only required to be insured and capable of obeying traffic laws.\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

            "full_content": "Tesla is offering some Cybertruck buyers free Supercharging as it grapples with sluggish demand for Elon Musk's electric pickup.\nThe offer applies to Foundation Series Cybertrucks — which start at about $95,000 — ordered on or after February 28 and is valid for the entire period of ownership, per a notice on Tesla's website.\nThe incentive cannot be transferred to other vehicles or owners and applies only to Tesla-branded Superchargers. The EV maker also says it reserves the right to revoke free Supercharging in the event of \"excessive charging.\"\nTesla's website didn't elaborate on what would be excessive, though it separately said the offer excluded vehicles used for commercial purposes such as ride-hailing. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, sent outside normal working hours.\nThere's no standardized cost for charging a Cybertruck, as prices vary between chargers across the US. Regardless, free lifetime charging would represent a significant cost saving for any Tesla user.\nThe incentive is the latest Tesla has introduced as it tries to drive demand for the Cybertruck.\nThe company began offering up to $1,600 off new Cybertrucks and a $2,600 discount on used vehicles in January and slashed leasing prices to $750 a month in recent weeks.\nTesla moved some workers off its Cybertruck production lines at its Austin factory at the start of the year, employees told Business Insider.\nSales of the electric truck, which had a torturous production ramp and launched at a higher price tag than expected, have been broadly underwhelming.\nTesla sold 38,965 Cybertrucks last year, according to data from Cox Automotive.\nThat was enough to make the stainless steel-clad EV the best-selling electric pickup truck in the US, but it was well below analyst expectations in late 2023 that Tesla would ship 48,500 units in 2024.\nDemand also slowed toward the end of the year, with Tesla delivering 12,991 Cybertrucks in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with 16,692 in the previous quarter.\nThe offer of free Supercharging for some Cybertruck owners has come as Tesla faces challenges on numerous fronts.\nThe automaker has seen sales collapse in Europe and is dealing with a high-profile backlash against Musk, its CEO, who has taken a prominent role in cutting the federal workforce via the White House DOGE office.\nThat backlash has made the Cybertruck, which is hardly inconspicuous at the best of times, a target, with some owners complaining that their vehicles have been vandalized and defaced with slogans criticizing Musk."

            "full_content": "Tesla shareholders recently got some bad news. According to Electrek, the electric vehicle giant is expected to ship the fewest number of vehicles in the first quarter of 2025 since Q3 of 2022.\nTesla is projected to deliver 359,000 units in Q1 2025, according to a Kalshi prediction market cited by Electrek. While that might sound like a lot, it's not for Tesla, and this may be part of a growing trend. Tesla sales have been declining worldwide, especially in Europe.\nAccording to numbers recently released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, Tesla vehicle registrations in the European Union and several other European countries dropped by about 45% between January 2024 and 2025, as NPR reported. Sales are down in Germany by a staggering 70% through February for year-over-year data, according to Electrek.\nMaybe even more concerning for Tesla is what's happening in China. China accounts for more than a third of global sales for Tesla, and it leads the world in total sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, but Tesla saw sales there drop by 11.5% in January, Inside EVs detailed.\nIn California, the largest EV market in the U.S., Tesla registrations dropped nearly 12% from 2023 to 2024 even while overall EV sales grew in the state, per Electrek.\nWhile Tesla sales may be down, global EV sales continue to grow and are expected to continue to do so, according to Statista. It appears as though, for one reason or another, consumers are choosing to go with other brands. Some of that was bound to happen to any company boasting sales of around 60% in its industry — about where Tesla was for the U.S. as recently as 2023, per a New York Times data chart — but the slide appears to be greater than most analysts would have likely expected at that point in time.\nSales in California are a good indicator of this slip. As mentioned, Tesla saw a significant drop in the state last year, but overall EV sales were still up 1.2%. Remove Tesla from that equation and non-Tesla EV sales increased by 20% from January 2023 to January 2024, per Electrek.\nSo, while this may be bad news for Tesla, it's not necessarily bad news for the world's transition away from gasoline and diesel engines, which are relatively inefficient and produce several times as much carbon dioxide pollution per mile, according to Recurrent.\nMore and more people are upgrading to an EV and rejecting gas-powered vehicles that produce planet-warming pollution, which in turn causes more extreme weather events that threaten lives and the global food supply.\nTesla has been fairly quiet about the slumping sales, and some Tesla supporters believe sales have simply stalled due to the upcoming Model Y changeover. It could also be because there are now more EVs available than ever to consumers.\nOthers say the sharp decline in Tesla sales is at least partially due to CEO Elon Musk's activity in U.S. and world politics. Those political efforts have been polarizing among U.S. citizens, with a general theme of aiming to dismantle U.S. government services and reduce the federal workforce while implying the country has a problem with a \"parasite class\" who don't earn enough money with their own jobs to avoid requiring help from any healthcare or retirement services.\nSome agree with that perspective and have said they support him more for it — with President Donald Trump saying he plans to buy a Tesla as a result — while others have said it drives them away from supporting a company Musk runs.\nOne person commented on the Electrek article, \"I'm the perfect example of the problem that Tesla is facing. I like EVs. I buy new cars. I'm the car buyer in a multi-driver family. MY most recent car purchase was a Hyundai Ioniq 5. Why? Elon Musk. As long as he's in charge I'll NEVER buy a Tesla.\"\nSeveral dozen readers liked this comment or posted to agree with it, though the drop in sales began before Musk took an active role in government this year, so it can't be entirely attributed to any one factor either. If Musk decided to step away and divest from Tesla, that may be the only way to have a pure view at the brand's success on its own — which, by most data-driven accounts from user satisfaction surveys and car reviews by experts, has been high.\nIn the meantime, Tesla may need a win soon to turn its fortunes around, as the company's stock has plummeted from a 52-week high of $488.54 to under $250 this week.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\n© 2025 Yahoo.

            "full_content": "Steve Wozniak, the cofounder of Apple, isn't a fan of how DOGE is tackling cost-cutting in the federal government. \nWozniak said that while he supports looking for inefficiencies, he does not think Elon Musk and DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce are the right approach.  \n\"Mass firings — not good for a business to run that way,\" he said in a conversation with CNBC on Wednesday. The Apple co-founder advised the group to be more strategic, saying that DOGE should act \"more surgically, with a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer.\" \nFederal agencies have fired thousands of employees in recent weeks and offered conflicting guidance on the terminations.\nThe Apple cofounder isn't outwardly political — he told CNBC that he decided not to vote when he was 18 — but did sign his name to a list of business leaders supporting former Vice President Kamala Harris during the election.\nVoting record aside, Wozniak said he's \"on the wrong side of Elon\" after criticizing Tesla in the past. The White House has repeatedly said that Musk isn't officially running DOGE, though Trump said in a speech on Tuesday night that the group \"is headed by Elon Musk,\" and many see him as the functional leader. \nTrump's comment was flagged as part of an existing lawsuit against DOGE shortly after the speech ended.\nWozniak isn't the only business personality who has criticized DOGE —billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has written about the group on Bluesky, a social media site that rivals Musk's X. Cuban said that DOGE will \"inevitably\" create a mess in one post and called its efforts \"not so brilliant\" in another. Some management experts have had choice words for DOGE's early tactics, previously telling BI that the group has been \"clumsy\" and \"wrongheaded\" so far.\nRepresentatives for the White House, DOGE, and Wozniak did not respond to BI's request for comment."

            "full_content": "Elon Musk has a message for his Tesla employees: Don't fear the stock's recent sell-off.\nIn a surprise all-hands meeting with Tesla staffers Thursday night, he said employees should \"hang on to your stock\" despite it losing roughly half its value since December.\nMusk spent the first half of the hourlong meeting giving updates on Tesla's safety record, its delivery figures, and the company's work on autonomous driving and robotics. The rest of the session was open to employees to ask questions.\nThe meeting, which was held on short notice at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, was livestreamed on X. It was scheduled to start at 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream cut out abruptly, sparking confusion among some employees. Tesla then started a new livestream, which displayed a loading screen until the meeting kicked off at 9:58 p.m. ET.\nTesla all-hands live presentation  https://t.co/jQOt6WB2LN\nTesla typically holds its all-hands meetings during regular work hours.\nHere are the five biggest takeaways from Tesla's all-hands meeting.\nMusk alluded to the turmoil surrounding Tesla's stock price while speaking about the company's autonomous driving ambitions.\n\"It's very difficult for people in the stock market — especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people — to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,\" Musk told employees.\nTesla's stock has declined in the past weeks as the company grapples with falling sales and the controversy surrounding Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Tesla showrooms have been hit with vandalism and protests nationwide.\n\"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?\" Musk said on Thursday night.\nThe company's stock price has dropped by more than 50% from its record highs in mid-December. Tesla shares closed at about $236 on Thursday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in December.\nMusk says autonomous driving will unlock Tesla's true value.\n\"It's so profound and there's no comparison with anything in the past. It just does not compute. But it will compute in the future. And some people, like Cathie Wood at ARK Invest, do see the future,\" Musk said on Thursday. ARK Invest set a $2,600 price target for Tesla's stock in June.\n\"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.\nTesla shares prices fell by half a percentage point after trading hours.\nWhen an employee asked Musk what Tesla's operations team should focus on in the next couple of years, Musk said the robotaxi, also known as the Cybercab, would be a priority.\n\"Well, we do want to scale up production to new heights, obviously, with the Cybercab. The Cybercab is not just a revolutionary car design, it's also a revolutionary manufacturing process,\" Musk said.\nMusk said the production process for the Cybercab wasn't like a \"normal car manufacturing line\" but instead resembled a \"high-speed consumer electronics line.\"\n\"In fact, the line will move so fast that actually, people can't even get close to it. I think it'll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds,\" Musk added.\nProducing Cybercabs at such speeds would require Tesla to scale up its casting process, Musk said.\n\"Let's see what is the limit of physics, of how big can a casting machine be. Let's find out. I'm game. I'm down,\" Musk continued.\nMusk unveiled Tesla's Cybercab at the company's \"We, Robot\" event in Los Angeles in October. During that presentation, Musk said the Cybercab would be in production before 2027.\nDuring a Tesla earnings call in October, Musk told investors the Cybercab will cost \"roughly $25,000.\" Musk said at the \"We, Robot\" event that he expects to sell the Cybercab for \"below $30,000.\"\n\"We are aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab. That will be in more than one factory, but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately,\" Musk said then, adding that the numbers were his \"best guesses.\"\nMusk said he expects Tesla to ramp up its production of Optimus robots this year.\n\"This year, we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots,\" Musk said in response to an employee's question about when the robots would be available to the public.\nMusk said Tesla aims to have enough parts to produce \"10,000, maybe 12,000\" robots.\n\"But since it's a totally new product — everything is totally new — I will say we are succeeding if we get half of the 10,000. But even 5,000 robots, that's the size of a Roman legion,\" Musk said.\n\"I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,\" he added.\nIn April, Musk said during an earnings call that the Optimus robots are Tesla's most valuable asset.\n\"Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robot that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy,\" Musk told investors.\nEmployees did not ask Musk questions about politics during the question-and-answer session, which lasted around 30 minutes.\nSome Tesla investors have criticized Musk's political involvement, saying it's weighing the company down.\nRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor, recently told BI that he doesn't expect Tesla's stock to rebound this year. He added that Musk had alienated Tesla's customers with his political activities and positions.\nDan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who has consistently been bullish on Tesla, warned on Wednesday that Musk's work with the White House DOGE office is turning Tesla into a \"political symbol,\" and urged Musk to \"take a step back and balance his DOGE and Tesla CEO roles.\"\nDespite the lack of questions on politics, Ives praised the all-hands in a note Friday, saying, \"Leaders lead in times of trouble and crisis....and last night Elon Musk took a major and much-needed step forward.\"\n\"This was a key moment for Musk and Tesla to show leadership and he did. We applaud Musk for 'reading the room' and showing important hand holding at this key time for employees and investors,\" the note added.\nIves added that \"challenges clearly remain\" for the company. He urged Musk to take a \"small step back\" from DOGE and focus more on Tesla.\nMusk told his workers on Thursday that he is \"stretched pretty thin,\" after one employee asked him if he is keen on making other products like airplanes or trains.\n\"I have like 17 jobs, at this point. I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, work, and then do that seven days a week pretty much,\" Musk said.\n\"I guess I like being productive. I like getting things done,\" he added.\nMusk runs half a dozen companies. Aside from Tesla, Musk splits his time between his rocket company, SpaceX, the social media platform X, the tunneling company The Boring Co., the neural-interface technology startup Neuralink, and the AI startup xAI.\nThat's in addition to his involvement with the White House DOGE office, where he's spearheading government spending cuts.\nMusk said in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow on March 10 that he was balancing his political and business work \"with great difficulty.\"\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from BI."

            "full_content": "Jaclyn Diaz\n    \n\n\n                An investigator looks over the scene at a Tesla Collision Center after a person used incendiary devices to set several vehicles on fire on Tuesday in Las Vegas. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said that five Teslas were damaged and believe that the suspect fired three rounds from a firearm at the vehicles and spray painted the word \"RESIST\" on the entrance.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThe Department of Justice announced charges Thursday against three people it says are allegedly responsible for violent incidents targeting Elon Musk's Tesla cars, showrooms and charging stations across the country.\nThe Justice Department says three people — in Charleston, S.C., Loveland, Colo., and Salem, Ore. — are facing criminal charges that carry a minimum penalty of five years and up to 20 years in prison for a range of violent acts. They include using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations and possessing other \"incendiary devices\" and a suppressed AR-15 rifle, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday. \n\"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\"\n\n                President Trump and White House senior adviser, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThe strong statement came less than two days after Bondi promised that such attacks on Tesla also would be considered \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" A representative for the DOJ didn't immediately respond to NPR's additional questions on what the agency plans to do next on this issue. \nTrump, for his part, has criticized the attacks and efforts to boycott Musk's companies and, last week, said he would purchase a Tesla vehicle to support his advisor.\nIn Las Vegas, police said Tuesday that five Teslas were damaged in an attack on a sales and service center. Police believe the suspect also shot a gun at the cars and spray-painted the word \"RESIST\" on the entrance. No one was injured, which was also the case in the Colorado, Oregon and South Carolina incidents.\nWhile no one has been injured or killed by these attacks, three professors and researchers of domestic terrorism and extremism tell NPR that they consider these cases to be acts of domestic terrorism.\n\"It's absolutely domestic terrorism. I know that may discomfort many people. But vandalism is a crime that if it's committed with a political motive, can certainly be defined as terrorism,\" says Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. He is the co-author of the forthcoming book, God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America.\nThese days, the concept of domestic terrorism has become increasingly complex, Hoffman says. While there are official definitions of domestic terrorism, there is no federal law on the matter. Here's a breakdown of what constitutes domestic terrorism,  how the U.S. has approached this issue in the past, and why it's important despite the lack of a specific law.  \nPublic anger toward Musk, a White House advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO and one of the world's richest men, is growing as he leads efforts to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency team. So far, this Trump administration entity has orchestrated the mass firings of thousands of government workers across multiple agencies in the past month.\nIn response, a grassroots protest has emerged in the form of the #TeslaTakedown movement. It is calling on Tesla drivers to sell their cars, dump company stock and join picket lines at Tesla showrooms. \n\n                People protesting Musk's actions in the Trump administration hold signs outside a Tesla showroom in Seattle on Feb. 13\n                \n                    \n                    Manuel Valdes/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nBut in some cases — including one of the people included in Bondi's announcement Thursday — the protests have taken a more violent turn. Two people have been arrested and are now facing state and federal charges tied to two separate attacks on a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., which involved throwing Molotov cocktails at the cars and, in one instance, spray-painting expletive-ridden messages on the showroom's windows. No one was killed or injured during either incident. \nLucy Grace Nelson, Daniel Brendan Kurt Clarke-Pounder and Adam Matthew Lansky are facing charges tied to their alleged vandalism of Tesla cars and dealerships in Colorado, South Carolina and Oregon, respectively.\nNelson is facing two charges of possession of an unregistered firearm and the malicious (attempted) destruction of property. She could face up to 30 years in prison.\nCourt documents allege that Nelson traveled to a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., on multiple nights in January and February, allegedly lighting Molotov cocktails and throwing them in the dealership's parking lot and spraying graffiti on the building's windows and walls.\nNelson's attorney, Mary V. Butterton, declined to comment on her client's case.\nLansky is facing one charge of unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm. But an affidavit alleges he is also responsible for throwing Molotov cocktails and shooting a gun at Tesla vehicles and dealership facilities in Salem, Ore., on at least two separate occasions in January and February. Lansky's attorney, Mark Patrick Ahlemeyer, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCourt documents allege that witnesses say they saw Clarke-Pounder on March 7 using red spray paint to write obscenities against Trump and \"Long Live Ukraine\" on a Tesla charging station parking spot in North Charleston, S.C. Clarke-Pounder then allegedly started lighting bottles on fire and throwing them at the Tesla charging stations, according to court documents. He's facing one charge of arson affecting interstate commerce.\nPatrick Chisum, Clarke-Pounder's attorney, told NPR that Clarke-Pounder is feeling overwhelmed. \n\"He's being accused of something that's very, very serious. And I think that the realization of how serious it's being taken, especially with Attorney General Bondi's statements, is kind of becoming self-evident. Both he and his family are very, very concerned and very scared,\" Chisum said.\nHe added that his client \"is a troubled young man who's been suffering from multiple mental health issues.\"\nThe U.S. doesn't have a stand-alone federal domestic terrorism law. But at least 32 states and Washington, D.C., have their own state-level domestic terrorism laws. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as, \"Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\"\nPeople might look at vandalism at a Tesla dealership and question whether it's terrorism, says Hoffman. \nBut going back to the 1990s, the FBI, as the lead agency responsible for investigating terrorism in the United States, has investigated acts of vandalism and arson like those committed by eco-terrorism groups and treated them as domestic terrorism, he says. \nOne of the more famous cases of eco-terrorism was committed by the group known as The Family. The FBI says the group has been linked to more than 40 criminal acts between 1995 and 2001, including arson and vandalism, causing more than $45 million in damages. The group's most notorious act was the 1998 arson attack on a ski resort in Vail, Colo. — which caused around $26 million in damages. \n\"To me, regardless of one's opinions of Tesla cars, and its owner, this isn't new,\" Hoffman says. \nA key element in determining what is domestic terrorism is the intent of the perpetrator. That can include a desire to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct, says Faiza Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center For Justice's Liberty and National Security Program.\nAnd the intent of the Tesla vandals falls under this umbrella, she says. \n\"The whole point ... is that [the vandals] are trying to influence government conduct. Everybody knows that Elon Musk is not only a federal employee, but is at the center of a lot of controversies about what the government is doing right now,\" Patel says.\nThe act would also have to fall under one of the laws listed in the federal code as a domestic terrorism offense. These include attacks that use certain types of weapons — for example, weapons of mass destruction — or include acts such as hostage-taking or involve special federal interest, such as attacks on federal officials.\nOther protesters have spray-painted swastikas and smashed windows of Tesla showrooms. But Patel says it's unlikely authorities will consider those cases of petty vandalism — or of someone keying a Tesla — to be domestic terrorism.\n\n                Investigators look over the scene at a Tesla Collision Center after a person set several vehicles on fire on Tuesday in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nExtremism experts have long warned that domestic terrorism, mainly coming from far-right and white supremacy groups, posed a far greater threat than foreign terrorism. Still, despite sporadic efforts to do so, no federal domestic terrorism law has been created due to a lack of consensus.\nBecause of this, people involved in acts determined to be domestic terrorism are still just charged with offenses such as arson, murder, kidnapping and assault. \nThe perpetrators of the most famous incident of U.S. domestic terrorism, the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 people, were never actually charged with domestic terrorism. Rather, Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator Terry L. Nichols were found guilty of several counts of murder and the use of a weapon of mass destruction or conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. \nAlthough there is no federal domestic terrorism law, prosecutors can point to a perpetrator's motive to classify a crime as terrorism during a trial and sentencing, which can affect a convicted person's punishment, says Laura Dugan, a professor of human security and professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. If a crime is determined to be an act of terrorism, a perpetrator could receive additional years on their sentence.\nEven after the Oklahoma City bombing, there was never enough agreement in Congress to support a domestic terrorism law, Hoffman says. It was always considered a highly politicized issue, he says.\n\"When you walked into a room going back to the 1990s and you talked about domestic terrorism there was a half of the room that immediately thought far-left radicals. And there was another half of the room that immediately thought white supremacists or seditious-minded conspiracy [believers],\" Hoffman says. \nHoffman believes it's \"a huge problem\" that the U.S. has no domestic terrorism statute. But Patel, whose Brennan Center has long opposed such a law, says this would only be weaponized by the federal government and would make it too easy for \"an administration to label unpopular groups or political enemies as a domestic terrorist outfit.\"\n\"I don't see how it benefits anybody,\" she says. \"Given how polarized our current political environment is, it seems to me a particularly bad idea.\"\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Mark Kelly of Arizona on Friday became one of the highest profile figures yet to ditch his Tesla in favor of a new ride, channeling the growing backlash against billionaire Elon Musk.\n\"Elon Musk kind of turned out to be an asshole,\" Kelly, a Democrat, said in a video posted on X, explaining why he sold his car. \"And I don't want to be driving a car built and designed by an asshole.\"\nKelly pulled up to Senate votes on Friday in front of the US Capitol in a 2025 Chevy Tahoe Z71, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider. Unlike his former Tesla, it is an all-gas vehicle. It gets an estimated 15 miles per gallon city, 20 mpg highway, and 17 mpg combined.\nChevy Tahoes are manufactured in Texas.\nTesla is increasingly bearing the brunt of Musk's rapidly declining popularity. Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their highs, and protests are hitting showrooms across the country. It's unmistakable that the company is paying the price for Musk's ties to the White House DOGE office.\nMusk serves as the de facto leader of DOGE, which has targeted government offices for layoffs. Musk previously claimed credit for dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID), saying he fed it into \"the woodchipper.\"\nTrump made a show of buying a Tesla earlier this week, showcasing a variety of the automaker's vehicles at the White House.\nKelly once got along with Musk. The former NASA astronaut has repeatedly praised the private space sector, which Musk's SpaceX remains a dominant force in. The pair's relationship has soured in recent weeks. Musk recently called Kelly, a Navy veteran, a \"traitor\" for visiting Ukraine.\n\"The only oath I can think of that maybe Elon has sworn is an oath to his own checking account, to his pocketbook, an oath, maybe, to ruining the lives of veterans,\" Kelly later said during an interview on MSNBC.\nAccording to YouGov, views of Tesla have plummeted since Musk entered the Trump administration. Public sentiment of the automaker is the worst it has been since the polling firm began tracking it in 2016, per data obtained by Sherwood."

X is based in the Austin area, which is covered by the federal court for Western District of Texas.\nThen came the two international lawsuits, first one filed in Ireland against Media Matters in December 2023, then one filed by X's Singapore affiliate last July, claiming the nonprofit improperly manipulated the platform to produce misleading reports that prompted a steep drop in advertising. Both cases are still pending.\nAt the same time, a fourth legal battle could be brewing in the United Kingdom.\nTwitter UK, a subsidiary of X, has sent Media Matters demand letters threatening defamation litigation over the same actions that led to the other lawsuits.\nTo Media Matters, the legal assault is an attempt to shift the blame over the X hemorrhaging advertising revenue.\nThe advertiser boycott touched a nerve for Musk during a 2023 interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit, where Musk used the F-word to curse out companies that decided to step back from the platform, telling brands \"don't advertise.\"\nYet Musk has also sued corporations for pulling back in advertising, a legal effort Musk expanded last month to include CVS, Lego, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Abbott Laboratories.\nSince Musk has assumed a prominent post in the White House advising President Trump, some advertisers are feeling new pressure, according to Business Insider, which reported that advertising insiders view spending money on ads on X a type of \"insurance policy\" to avoid being sued, or become the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the Trump administration.\nFor Media Matters, defending against multiple lawsuits from Musk at once has sapped the group's resources and chilled its research and reporting on Musk and his companies, according to the suit.\nFor instance, in the ten months before the lawsuits started, Media Matters staffer Eric Hananoki authored 16 reports criticizing Musk and X over the proliferation of hateful and extremist content. Since the litigation, Hananoki has not written a single report on Musk.\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

            "full_content": "Tesla's stock is tanking over fears of slowing sales, increasing competition, and a CEO who's busy spending his time in Washington, DC. So far, 2025 looks like the electric vehicle company's annus horribilis.\nYou wouldn't know it from talking to employees.\nThe plummeting stock performance is \"only concerning if you're a short-term investor,\" one Tesla worker in the company's sales department said. \"It feels like we're in a storm right now, but I'm personally very confident in the company.\"\nBusiness Insider spoke with 10 Tesla employees across different roles and locations in recent days. All but one — a worker who left this year — are still with the company, and nine own Tesla stock. They spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid professional reprisal. The conversations shed light on how some inside the company are weathering the recent abysmal stock performance.\nThe general sentiment? Shrug.\nSeveral pointed to the fact that the company's stock is up about 30% from this time last year. Over the past five years, it has spiked over 800%.\nFour workers said they actively avoid looking at the share price. \"If you're looking every day, you're going to drive yourself crazy,\" one Texas employee said. There are many variables that could impact its market performance, the employee added — namely the dealings of CEO Elon Musk — that are out of employees' control.\nIn an informal company forum where some employees discuss the stock performance, the attitude appears to be similar. Workers haven't been posting anything out of the ordinary, five employees said; the channel, which has a few thousand users, is often used to share tweets and news stories about Tesla.\nOne worker in Nevada said the internal atmosphere was far from \"depressing\" or \"alarming.\"\nA spokesperson for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.\nHistorically, stock grants have played a large role in Tesla compensation, and some workers have seen it as one of the company's most attractive features. Musk said in 2023 that the company has made people working Tesla's factory line millionaires.\n\"There's definitely some people who want to work at Tesla because they think they'll get rich fast on the stock, but those people don't last long,\" the former worker said.\nTwo other workers said the stock's volatility had nudged them toward long-term cash options, which allow employees to receive cash awards that are typically paid out over a period of four years.\nIn general, Tesla offers lower base salaries than its tech and automotive peers but provides the opportunity for substantial stock grants, according to a 2021 internal pay sheet.\nIn 2024, Tesla granted workers an estimated $2.69 billion in restricted stock units and about $3.5 billion in stock options, according to its annual report, which breaks down the number of RSUs and options granted as well as the average value.\nTwo workers said they felt Tesla's share price was the least of workers' concerns. The carmaker has faced an onslaught of protests over Musk's association with Donald Trump and the White House DOGE office.\nIn February, The New York Times reported that a Tesla manager, Jared Ottmann, had been terminated after he criticized one of Musk's social media posts that referenced Nazi leaders.\n\"How often do you think about your CEO?\" asked one engineer, who said they'd grown frustrated with questions about Musk. \"Do you hold yourself personally responsible for their behavior?\"\nStill, eight workers said they felt generally optimistic about the future of the company.\n\"It's an old story,\" one manager said. \"Elon has always been in this controversial space, but if the product is good enough people are going to buy it anyway.\"\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

            "full_content": "A Tesla Cybertruck is on display at the Tesla showroom in Buena Park, Calif., Dec. 3, 2023.\nU.S. safety regulators on Thursday recalled virtually all Cybertrucks on the road, the eighth recall of the Tesla-made vehicles since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recall, which covers more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, warned that an exterior panel that runs along the left and right side of the windshield can detach while driving, creating a dangerous road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash.\nThe stainless steel strip, called a cant rail assembly, between the windshield and the roof on both sides, is bound to the truck’s assembly with a structural adhesive, the NHTSA report said. The remedy uses an adhesive that’s not been found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement,” the NHTSA said, and includes additional reinforcements.\nTesla will replace the panel free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed May 19, 2025.\nThe recall of 46,096 Cybertrucks covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025. The NHTSA order says that Tesla became aware of the problem early this year.\nVideos posted on social media showing people ripping the panels off of Cybertrucks with their hands have gone viral in recent days.\nThe Cybertruck, which Tesla began delivering to buyers in late 2023, has been recalled eight times in the past 15 months for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix acceleration pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim. Other recalls were related to windshield wipers and the display screen.\nIt's the latest setback for the Elon Musk-owned electric automaker, which has come under attack since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that’s slashing government spending.\nWhile no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.\nProsecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” spray-painted on a building.\nAnd federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.\nEven before the attacks ramped up in recent weeks, Tesla has been struggling, facing increased competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China.\nThough largely unaffected by Thursday's recall announcement, Tesla shares have plummeted 42% in 2025, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.\nWith regard to Thursday's recall, Cybertruck owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752 and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236, or go to nhtsa.gov.\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

            "full_content": "Oops, something went wrong\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Days before Republicans took the helm of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January, the agency's five commissioners held a closed-door vote on whether to sue Elon Musk.\nSince 2022, the agency had been investigating whether the billionaire, a close ally of incoming President Donald Trump, had violated securities laws by disclosing too late his purchase of shares of Twitter, now known as X, prior to acquiring the company that year.\nFour of the five commissioners, including Republican Hester Peirce, voted yes, three sources said. The fifth - Republican Mark Uyeda, now the acting head of the SEC - voted no, the people said.\nThe week after the 4-1 vote in favor, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk on January 14.\nThe details of the vote - including Uyeda's dissent - are reported here for the first time.\nIn the days before the vote, Uyeda pressed enforcement staff involved in the Musk case to sign pledges that the case was not driven by politics, according to two of the sources. That effort was first reported by Bloomberg News. The staff refused to sign the pledge, as it is not typical SEC practice, the sources told Reuters.\nTwo of the sources said Uyeda and his fellow Republican Peirce took issue with what the SEC wanted Musk to pay - giving up $150 million in alleged unjust enrichment plus a penalty. Nonetheless, Peirce joined with the three Democrats in voting to sue.\nAn SEC spokesperson declined to comment about the vote or the Musk case on behalf of the agency and Uyeda. The SEC also denied a public records request by Reuters for the voting record. Peirce, Musk, his lawyer and the White House did not answer questions from Reuters.\nUnder U.S. law, investors who accumulate a stake exceeding 5% of a company's outstanding shares must disclose that holding within 10 days. Musk’s disclosure in April 2022 sent Twitter’s share price soaring 27% over the previous close. Because Musk's disclosure came 21 days after his purchase, the SEC has said, he was able to buy more shares at lower prices, ultimately allowing him to save $150 million on his acquisition of Twitter.\nTwitter shareholders have also sued Musk for fraud.\nIn addition to the timing of his disclosure, investigators at the agency examined whether they could prove any intent behind his late filing, which could have led to more serious charges, according to two of the sources and a third person with knowledge of the investigation.\nMusk has said he disclosed the stake promptly after realizing he misunderstood the SEC disclosure rule and the SEC ultimately did not bring any charges alleging intent.\nThat line of inquiry, and Musk's delays added time to the investigation, the sources said. He agreed to be deposed twice in 2022 but subsequently refused to be interviewed a third time, leading the SEC to ask a court to compel his additional testimony. On Oct. 3, 2024 he appeared, but that year-long tug of war ensured the matter could not be concluded before the election.\nIn December, a month before filing the lawsuit, the SEC attempted to reach a settlement with Musk. Musk posted a copy of his lawyer Alex Spiro’s response to the SEC’s then-Chair Gary Gensler on X saying the agency had given him 48 hours to agree to pay a penalty to settle the probe or face civil charges. The two sides did not settle.\nSix legal experts interviewed by Reuters questioned why the SEC took so long to bring a late filing case.\n\"They could have brought it closer to the timing of the conduct,” said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer who worked at the SEC under President Barack Obama and President Trump. “But bringing it at the last minute – literally – it loses credibility. That’s problematic for any agency, especially when dealing with such an obviously politicized issue.”\nStill, some said not bringing a case at all would raise questions of selective enforcement of U.S. laws.\n“It’s certainly not the violation of the century, but if we care about fair markets and fair enforcement, it would be humiliating for the SEC, a fiercely independent agency, to be seen as backing down,\" said Robert Frenchman of Dynamis law firm in New York.\nMusk has feuded with the SEC since 2018 when the agency sued him for tweeting that he had secured funding to take his electric car maker Tesla private. Since then, Musk has repeatedly derided the SEC, calling it a \"totally broken organization.\"\nMusk has until April 4 to respond to a summons in this case, according to a court filing on Thursday.\nTrump issued an executive order accusing the SEC and other agencies of politically motivated investigations under former President Joe Biden and directing a review of cases over the past four years. The SEC’s spokesperson declined to comment on that review.\n(Reporting by Chris PrenticeAdditional reporting by Douglas Gillison in Washington; Editing by Michael Learmonth )\nSign in to access your portfolio"

            "full_content": "Tecnología, ciencia y cultura digital\t\t\t\t\nLas ventas de Tesla en el viejo continente, con la suma de Europa continental y las Islas Británicas, han caído drásticamente en el mes de enero, última fecha de las que se tienen datos de ventas de la compañía de Elon Musk. Las razones principales, según apuntan desde Investing, es el aumento de la demanda de modelos chinos, más baratos en precio, y también una mayor competencia por parte de los fabricantes europeos, aunque siguen por detrás de los anteriores.\nEn este sentido, según la Asociación Europea de Libre Comercio, las matriculaciones de nuevos Tesla han caído un 45,5% en el interanual, con 9.945 matriculaciones, lo que ha supuesto también una contracción de la cuota de mercado de Elon Musk del 1,8 al 1% respecto al año anterior.\nNo obstante, es también resultado de una caída de ventas en general, del 2,1% total de las matriculaciones en el mes de enero. Y es aplicable a algunos de los mercados más importantes de Europa, incluyendo Francia, Italia y Alemania. Con todo, los eléctricos han ganado terreno en general en Europa, con un aumento de la cuota de mercado que ha pasado al 15% desde el 10,9% desde el año pasado.\nLas ventas totales de eléctricos han crecido un 34%, hasta las 124.341 unidades. No obstante, parece que Tesla no ha sido capaz de capitalizar ese aumento de ventas en Europa, a menos en este último mes de enero. Por su parte,\nPero Tesla parece no haber sabido aprovechar la creciente popularidad de los vehículos eléctricos en la región. Las ventas de Volkswagen crecieron un 14,9% en enero en lo relativo a su oferta de vehículos eléctricos. \nCon todo, el ganador ha sido el fabricante chino SAIC Motor, que registró un aumento de casi el 37% en las ventas, muy por delante de Tesla. Y además, ensanchó su cuota de mercado en la región hasta el 2,3%, también muy por encima de Tesla, aunque lógicamente con un precio menor por unidad vendida que los coches de la empresa americana.\nPor su parte, las ventas de vehículos de combustión han resultado en sentido contrario y cayeron un 18,9%, a 290.301 unidades. Quién sabe si el Model Y Juniper de Tesla será el revulsivo que necesite para cambiar la situación"

That is, perhaps, until now. \nBritish startup Longbow — founded by former Tesla, Lucid, and Polestar execs — emerged from stealth today with plans for two new ultralight EVs. The company bills the cars as “spiritual successors” to the iconic Lotus Elise and Jaguar E-Type.\nThe first of the pair is Speedster, a nimble, open-top sports car weighing just 895kg that could accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 3.5 seconds. Speedster will have an estimated range of 275 miles and a starting price of ₤84,995. The first customer deliveries are slated for 2026.\nLongbow said it initially wants to build 150 Speedsters. Following that, it plans to put its full attention on the EV’s slightly bulkier and cheaper brother — the Roadster. Costing ₤64,995 and weighing 995kg, the Roadster will be heavier but only marginally slower, accelerating from 0 to 100km/h in 3.6 seconds.  \nBoth the Speedster and the Roadster are featherweights in comparison to today’s EVs, which on average weigh around 2,000kg. In the sports car class, Tesla’s Roadster, which tipped the scales at 1,305kg, was one of the lightest ever to enter serial production, but that was phased out in 2012.  \n“Our first two cars embody everything a modern driver’s car should be: agile, balanced, electric, and exhilarating,” said Longbow’s co-founder and CEO David Davey, whose previous accomplishments include launching Lucid Motors in Europe and claims to have driven the Tesla Roadster that Elon Musk launched into space. “We are reviving an icon, the lightweight British sports car,” he said. \nTogether, the Roadster and Speedster represent a whole new class of cars — and a middle finger to the auto establishment. \nOver the years, EVs have been getting bigger and bigger — in market share, sure — but also in physical size. That’s partly because batteries are getting heavier and taking up more space. But it’s also because automakers are catering to demand for electric equivalents of SUVs, pickup trucks, and even hummers. \n“Astonishingly, the very segment that sparked the electric revolution — the global 2 seater sports car market worth approximately $16bn, encompassing around 250,000 vehicles per year — remains almost untouched by electrification,” Davey wrote on LinkedIn. \nWith most established automakers all competing in the same segment, Longbow looks to seize a gap in the market. \nThat all sounds great, but what sets this apart from all the other fancy 3D renders out there?\nFirst, Longbow’s CV is drenched in EV acumen. The founders — Davey, Jenny Keisu, and Mark Tapscott — have combined experience launching electric vehicles at Tesla, Uber, Polestar, and Lucid. Keisu was the CEO of X Shore, adding electric boating expertise into the mix. “We bring experience from the heart of EV innovation, understanding intimately how to design and deliver game-changing vehicles at commercial scale,” said Davey. \nThen there’s Longbow’s rather modest designs and specs. Instead of reinventing the wheel, the company is adopting a basic aluminium chassis, featuring reusable and configurable parts for greater durability. It also plans to source most of the car’s parts from third parties. That includes a rather basic 240kW motor, readily available off-the-shelf. \nYes, this all makes both the Speedster and Roadster slower than an electric hypercar and less fancy than a Porsche Taycan or Maserati Granturismo Folgore. But then again, it’s also a fraction of the price. Longbow’s pair of EVs could be the sweet spot for someone looking for a Sunday drive to replace their old Porsche Boxster or Lotus Elise. \nThe Speedster and Roadster are already available for pre-order. And Longbow — which has been operating in stealth for the last few years — hopes to unveil its first prototype later this year. \n“We’re not naïve about the challenges ahead,” said Davey. “Scaling production, navigating global supply chain complexities, and confronting competition from legacy automakers requires strategic foresight.” For these reasons, the company will start with a limited edition Speedster of 150 units before moving to series production of the Roadster.\n“The Next in Tech” is one of three key themes at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam.

            "full_content": "Tesla's fierce battle to remain the world's top EV company has just hit another roadblock.\nOn Monday, Chinese EV giant BYD reported annual revenues of 777 billion yuan for 2024. At current exchange rates, that equates to roughly $107 billion. By contrast, Tesla's annual revenue last year was $97.7 billion.\nBYD's net profit jumped 34% year-over-year to just over 40 billion yuan, equivalent to $5.55 billion at current exchange rates. That exceeded analyst expectations of $5.44 billion, though it was below Tesla's $7.1 billion 2024 profit.\nBYD's sales surge has been relentless. In January, it sold nearly twice as many EVs as Tesla, which saw sales slump by 11% year-over-year.\nBy early December, the Chinese carmaker had already surpassed its annual target, selling over 3.7 million cars in 11 months — eclipsing its 3.6 million goal with a month to spare. Ultimately, it sold 4.27 million EVs in 2024.\nTesla, meanwhile, suffered its first annual sales decline in more than a decade. It delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, down 1% from 2023's 1.81 million, despite a record-breaking 495,570 vehicle deliveries in Q4.\nAdding to Tesla's woes, BYD last week unveiled super-fast 1,000 kW chargers it says can add almost 250 miles of range to an electric vehicle in five minutes — four times as powerful as Tesla's current 250 kW chargers, which Elon Musk's automaker says can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes. Tesla plans to roll out 500 kW chargers this year.\nTesla has also had a rough start to the year. CEO Musk's aggressive cost-cutting efforts at DOGE have sparked a backlash against his EV maker, with Tesla facilities facing arson attacks, vandalism, and boycott calls across the US and Europe.\nOver the past three months, Tesla stock has more than halved, and JPMorgan analysts slashed their price target to $135.\nHowever, the stock jumped as much as 10% on Monday, extending gains since Musk called a last-minute all-hands meeting with staff last Thursday.\nBYD also faces challenges in its quest for global expansion, including protective measures like Russia's import taxes, the US' high tariffs, and EU tariffs.\nBYD's executive vice president, Stella Li, told The Sunday Times of London the tariffs would have the opposite effect and \"weaken\" local industries.\nSwedish EV battery maker Northvolt, once seen as Europe's hope for an EV battery manufacturer to rival Asian automakers, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. It cited growing capital costs, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demand as reasons for its bankruptcy.\nLi also dismissed claims that BYD enjoys unfair state subsidies and accused European automakers of lagging behind Chinese brands in innovation.\n\"Our car is more stylish than any European-designed cars,\" she told the newspaper. \"Our car is more intelligent.\""

            "full_content": "Elon Musk jetted into Austin for a surprise all-hands at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory on Thursday night. His visit left some workers feeling everything from confusion to reassurance to cynicism.\nOne longtime Tesla engineer said they felt it was \"a positive sign\" that Musk appears to still value the electric car manufacturer and its mission.\n\"He always comes back to Tesla,\" the engineer said. Musk, who is involved with six different companies, has split his time between the ventures for years, they added — and the CEO's recent work with the Department of Government Efficiency isn't any different.\nTwo other workers said the all-hands helped strike a hopeful tone for the company.\nA worker based in California, meanwhile, said they felt \"cynical\" about the event, particularly Musk's remarks on \"sustainable energy for all.\" The worker pointed to Musk's ties to Trump, who has gone after electric vehicle incentives.\nThomas Temme, a senior software engineer, echoed the California worker. \"He restated his mission about sustainable energy and achieving 'sustainable abundance' and it sounded really good,\" Temme said. \"But it doesn't really fit together with all of his politics.\"\nTemme added that he appreciated Musk's willingness to answer questions from employees, and saw the all-hands as a positive for the company.\nThe California worker compared the event, which kicked off around 10 p.m. ET, to a \"publicity stunt\" due to its timing and the short notice for employees. (Several workers said they were notified of the all-hands less than an hour before it was scheduled to start.)\nAnother worker, based in Nevada, said they felt the event was all about \"appeasing shareholders\" and tuned out less than halfway through.\nTesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTwo other workers told BI they heard about the event on Musk's social media site X before they learned about it via internal company channels, leading to some confusion about the meeting, especially after the apparent technical difficulties with the public livestream. One worker said they never received an email about the all-hands, and four more said they skipped it entirely.\nDuring the event, Musk provided updates on Tesla's delivery numbers and its work on Robotaxi and Optimus. Musk also took half of the event to answer questions from the group of workers he was addressing at the Texas Gigafactory.\nNotably, no Tesla employees asked about DOGE, but Musk told staff he was \"stretched pretty thin\" in response to a question about whether he would consider manufacturing additional products like airplanes or trains.\nMusk's private jet returned to an airport near Washington, D.C. less than two hours after the event ended, according to data from jet-tracking company JetSpy.\nAt least one analyst took Musk's presence at the factory as a positive sign.\nWedbush Securities' Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday morning that Musk had taken \"a big step forward\" in meeting with Tesla employees.\nThe carmaker's stock has climbed more than 4% from yesterday. It's down about 39% year-to-date.\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Tesla plans to roll out 500 kW chargers this year.\nThe reveal of BYD's new \"super E-platform\" sparked a share price rally, with the company's stock jumping as much as 4% to hit a record high.\nTesla's Supercharger network, which Elon Musk's company began offering in China in 2014, has been crucial in helping it become the world's biggest EV company.\nBut lengthy charging times and range anxiety are still cited as some of the main reasons people are reluctant to buy EVs. That has sparked a global race to build batteries and chargers that can make charging an electric car as simple as filling up a tank of gas.\nThe Chinese firms Zeekr and CATL unveiled batteries that could almost fully charge in 10 minutes last year, while Mercedes-Benz last week said its new CLA coupe would be able to add up to 200 miles of range in 10 minutes.\nBYD now appears to have leapfrogged its rivals in China and elsewhere with its new charging tech. The tech is set to make its debut on the company's new Han and Tang L EVs, set to go on sale later this year for 270,000 to 360,000 yuan, or $37,300 to $49,800.\n\"In order to completely solve users' charging anxiety, our goal is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refueling time of fuel vehicles,\" BYD's chairman and founder, Wang Chuanfu, said at a press conference.\nThe new chargers are the latest in a spree of technological advances announced by BYD in recent weeks.\nThe company in February said it would install advanced self-driving features on its entire vehicle lineup, and earlier this month it unveiled a new roof-mounted drone system.\nEV companies in China are under huge pressure to roll out high-tech features such as autonomous driving and voice control as they compete to survive in the country's brutally competitive car market.\nTesla, which counts China as one of its most important markets, is also feeling the heat.\nThe US automaker saw its Chinese sales fall 49% in February — compared with a 161% rise for BYD — and began offering free trials of its own autonomous driving system on Monday as it looks to claw back market share."

It said the investigation showed that a few weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a cell working for Russian intelligence was set up and planned a large-scale disinformation campaign in German-speaking countries, particularly Austria. \nThe group was active online but also used stickers and graffiti with content such as far-right symbols and nationalist statements meant to look like pro-Ukrainian activists were responsible for them, according to the Interior Ministry.\nThe Bulgarian suspect, whose name wasn't released, is believed to have played a significant role in the effort and acted as an intelligence contact, the ministry said, adding that she has admitted working for the cell, particularly in 2022.\nA year ago, Austria's biggest espionage scandal in decades erupted with the arrest of a former Austrian intelligence officer, who was accused among other things of handing over cellphone data of former high-ranking Austrian officials to Russian intelligence and helping plot a burglary at a prominent journalist’s apartment.\nThe ex-officer, who was later released from custody, is suspected of having provided sensitive information to Jan Marsalek, a fugitive fellow Austrian wanted on suspicion of fraud since the collapse in 2020 of German payment company Wirecard, where he was the chief operating officer. The arrest warrant said chat messages provided by British authorities link Marsalek directly to Russia's FSB intelligence agency.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

            "full_content": "Bayerns Oberstes Landesgericht hat in einem Musterverfahren entschieden, dass es gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfung EY keinen Anspruch auf Schadensersatz gibt.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Plateresca/Shutterstock.com)\n    \nIn einem Musterverfahren von Wirecard-Anlegern gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY hat das Bayerische Oberste Landesgericht Schadensersatzforderungen gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfer eine Absage erteilt. Die Firma habe zwar die Bilanzen von Wirecard bis zu deren Kollaps im Sommer 2020 bestätigt, diese aber nicht selbst veröffentlicht und sei damit nicht verantwortlich, so das Gericht laut dpa.\nGerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt zufolge seien in Musterverfahren gebündelte Klagen wegen falscher Information des Kapitalmarkts zulässig, etwa falsche Bilanzen oder Pflichtmitteilungen. Diese lägen in diesem Fall seitens EY nicht vor. Dies bedeute aber nicht, dass Anleger nicht gegen EY klagen könnten. Grundlage dafür müsste aber eine Verletzung der Prüfpflicht sein.\nAuf der anderen Seite des Verhandlungstisches wird die Entscheidung kritisiert, Musterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil bezeichnete die Entscheidung als \"hundertprozentig falsch\" und kündigte eine Beschwerde beim Bundesgerichtshof an.\nEin ziviles Musterverfahren gegen den ehemaligen Vorstandschef Markus Braun und zwei Mitangeklagte läuft seit Dezember 2022 parallel. Nach Worten der Richterin haben mittlerweile knapp 8700 Anleger auf Schadenersatz geklagt. Weitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. Gegen Braun und andere ehemalige Wirecard-Größen wird in dem Musterverfahren ohne Umweg über den BGH weiterverhandelt.\nAls Musterkläger tritt hier stellvertretend für alle Kläger ein hessischer Bankkaufmann auf, der mit Wirecard Aktien eine halbe Million Euro verlor. Laut dpa ist das Ziel der Kläger aber die Firma EY, da bei dem Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und anderen Beteiligten kein Geld zu holen sei. Dagegen ist EY solvent und könnte einen potenziellen Schadensersatz auszahlen.\nZudem läuft seit 2022 das Strafverfahren gegen Braun sowie die mitangeklagten Jan Marsalek und Oliver Bellenhaus.\n\n    Keine News verpassen!

            "full_content": "In London hat das Strafgericht drei Bulgaren verurteilt, die für Russland Spionage betrieben haben – auch in Deutschland. Ihr mutmaßlicher Anführer war der flüchtige Wirecard-Milliardenbetrüger Jan Marsalek.\nDas Strafgericht Old Bailey hat am Freitagnachmittag die Urteile im Prozess gegen mehrere bulgarische Staatsbürger gesprochen, die dem von Wirecard-Ex-Vorstand Jan Marsalek angeführten Spionagering angehörten. Die 33 Jahre alte Katrin Ivanova, die 30 Jahre alte Vanya Gaberova und der 39 Jahre alte Tihomir Ivanchev wurden alle wegen „Verschwörung“ schuldig gesprochen. Zwei weitere Bulgaren, der Anführer Orlin Roussew und Biser Dzhambazow, hatten schon zu Beginn des Prozesses Geständnisse abgelegt und sich der Spionage schuldig bekannt.\nIhre Aktivitäten nannten die Ermittler den wichtigsten Fall von Spionage seit Jahrzehnten im Königreich. Dominic Murphy, Chef einer Anti-Terror-Einheit von Scotland Yard, sagte: „Das war Spionage in einem fast schon industriellen Ausmaß für Russland und russische Geheimdienste.“\nLaut Anklage, der das Gericht folgte, hat das Trio in den Jahren 2020 bis 2023 verschiedene Ziele ausspioniert, darunter russische und kasachische Dissidenten, moskaukritische Investigativjournalisten und ukrainische Soldaten in einem Ausbildungsstützpunkt in einer Stuttgarter Kaserne. Der Spionagering beratschlagte und plante dabei auch, putinkritische Journalisten zu kidnappen. Sogar die Tötung von Opfern wurde besprochen. Die weiblichen Spioninnen beschatteten sie auf europäischen Flügen, machten Fotos und versuchten mit ihnen als „Honigfalle“ anzubandeln, um kompromittierende Videos zu produzieren.\nDie bulgarischen Spione agierten dabei unter Leitung von Marsalek, der unter dem Decknamen Rupert Ticz auftrat. Nach Einschätzung der Ermittler soll Marsalek schon im Jahr 2014 als Agent für Russland angeworben worden sein. Der Österreicher setzte sich im Sommer 2020, als der Milliardenbetrug beim Zahlungsdienstleister Wirecard aufflog, ins Ausland ab. Nach Einschätzung von Polizeibehörden hält er sich jetzt mutmaßlich in Russland auf. Marsalek war in dem Strafprozess in London nicht selbst angeklagt.\nDie Ermittler haben etwa 80.000 Telegram-Nachrichten sichergestellt und ausgewertet, die Marsalek alias Ticz mit Orlin Roussew, einem Mittelsmann und lokalen Anführer der Spione, austauschte. Bei den fünf Angeklagten fanden die Ermittler 77 gefälschte Pässe auf 55 Fake-Namen aus verschiedenen Ländern wie Großbritannien, Frankreich, Italien, Spanien, Kroatien, der Slowakei, Griechenland und der Tschechischen Republik. Das Strafmaß gegen die fünf wird später verkündet.\nWirtschaftskorrespondent mit Sitz in London.\n Kurse und Finanzdaten zum Artikel: \n Im Bundeshaushalt droht eine Lücke von bis zu 60 Milliarden Euro.

            "full_content": "Stand: 28.02.2025 14:19 Uhr\n\nIm Prozess um milliardenschwere Schadenersatzforderungen Zehntausender Wirecard-Aktionäre versetzt ein Gericht den Klägern einen Dämpfer. Denn ihre Hoffnung hatten sie vor allem auf EY gesetzt.\n\n\nEine erste Entscheidung des bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts dämpft im Wirecard-Skandal die Hoffnungen Zehntausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz. Im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahren können demzufolge keine Schadenersatzansprüche gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY vorgebracht werden, die die Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns bis zu dessen Kollaps im Sommer 2020 bestätigt hatten. Das verkündete heute Gerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt.\n\n\nexklusiv\n\n03.02.2025\n\nEx-Wirecard-Vorstand Marsalek wollte offenbar eine US-Militärbasis in Stuttgart ausforschen lassen.\n                                    mehr\n\n\nMusterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil nannte die Entscheidung \"hundertprozentig falsch\" und kündigte Beschwerde beim Bundesgerichtshof an. \"Wir werden jetzt Rechtsbeschwerde einlegen.\" Die Vizepräsidentin der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW), Daniela Bergdolt, betonte, notfalls würden Aktionärsansprüche gegen EY in anderen Prozessen geltend gemacht. Ein EY-Sprecher sagte, das Unternehmen bewerte die Schadensersatzklagen nach wie vor als unbegründet. Die Entscheidung des Obersten Landesgerichts nehme man zur Kenntnis.\n\nDas zivilrechtliche Musterverfahren vor dem Bayerischen Obersten Landesgericht läuft parallel zum Strafprozess, in dem sich Ex-Vorstandschef Markus Braun und zwei Mitangeklagte seit Dezember 2022 verantworten müssen. Auf Schadenersatz geklagt haben nach Worten der Richterin mittlerweile knapp 8.700 Anleger. Weitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. Als Musterkläger hat der 1. Zivilsenat quasi stellvertretend einen hessischen Bankkaufmann ausgewählt, der eine halbe Million Euro mit Wirecard-Papieren verloren hatte.\n\nEigentliche Zielscheibe der Kläger ist jedoch EY: Das Unternehmen ist solvent, während bei Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und den von Insolvenzverwaltern vertretenen Firmenresten nach allgemeiner Einschätzung nichts mehr zu holen ist. EY hatte die mutmaßlich falschen Bilanzen des 2020 zusammengebrochenen DAX-Konzerns geprüft und abgesegnet. Im Hintergrund stehen Aktionärsforderungen von bis zu 8,5 Milliarden Euro.\nMehr als vier Jahre nach der Pleite von Wirecard hat in Bayern das Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahren begonnen. \n                                    br\n\n\nGerichtspräsidentin Schmidt begründete den \"Teilmusterentscheid\" so: In Musterverfahren gebündelt werden können nur Klagen wegen falscher Information des Kapitalmarkts. Gemeint sind damit unter anderem falsche Bilanzen und falsche Pflichtmitteilungen an die Börse. EY hat jedoch nach Argumentation des Senats die falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen inklusive des Bestätigungsvermerks nicht selbst veröffentlicht, sondern die Wirecard-Chefetage. Insofern sind Schadenersatzansprüche gegen EY im Musterverfahren laut Gericht \"nicht statthaft\".\n\nDie Entscheidung bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass Wirecard-Aktionäre grundsätzlich nicht gegen EY klagen können. Doch Grundlage müsste nach Worten der Richterin die \"Verletzung von Prüfpflichten\" sein, nicht die falsche Information des Kapitalmarkts. Die Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Braun und andere ehemalige Wirecard-Größen werden in dem Musterverfahren ohne Umweg über den BGH weiter verhandelt. \"Es geht weiter\", sagte Schmidt.\n\nDas Verfahren ist eines der umfangreichsten der deutschen Historie. Wirecard brach im Juni 2020 zusammen, als aufflog, dass dem Zahlungsabwickler auf Treuhandkonten in Asien 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlten. Es handelt sich um einen der größten Finanzskandale der Nachkriegsgeschichte. Zur Aufarbeitung der Pleite laufen immer noch etliche Gerichtsverfahren. Ex-Wirecard-Chef Braun sitzt wegen eines Betrugsprozesses in Untersuchungshaft und kam heute nicht zum Gerichtstermin.\nDieses Thema im Programm: Über dieses Thema berichtete MDR aktuell am 28.

            "full_content": "A jury at the Old Bailey, London’s Central Criminal Court, has just found six of my compatriots — citizens of Bulgaria — guilty of conspiring with the Kremlin to kidnap and possibly murder me and my colleague and friend, Roman Dobrokhotov. The Bulgarians, the jury acknowledged, had been recruited and run by former Wirecard COO Jan Marsalek, who first came to my attention when I investigated his disappearance from Austria and subsequent re-emergence in Moscow in 2020. For years, while no one seemed to be watching, Marsalek had quietly siphoned off billions from the publicly traded German company where he worked as a top-level executive, leaving a gaping hole in its balance sheet. In parallel, he had equally quietly volunteered his services to Russian intelligence — including to the same FSB unit that Roman and I had proven was behind the August 2020 poisoning of Alexei Navalny.\nThe investigation that started it all\n“Who is this Christo Grozev?”\nA series of close calls — and escalating threats\nThe downfall of my would-be kidnappers\nThe hunt for me had apparently begun in December 2020, immediately after my investigative team at Bellingcat, where I then worked, teamed up with The Insider, Der Spiegel, and CNN to publish the definitive history behind Navalny’s poisoning. We exposed the real identities, flight logs, and phone billing data of multiple FSB operatives who had trailed Navalny across Russia before ultimately administering a near-fatal dose of the Soviet-era nerve agent onto his underpants after breaking into the opposition figure’s Tomsk hotel room. Within hours of our investigation going live, as we later found out, President Vladimir Putin had personally tasked the FSB’s Internal Security Directorate with finding out how on earth we’d obtained such sensitive information — information that greatly embarrassed the security service Putin himself had once headed.\nI’d soon learn, thanks to a police raid more than two years later, that on the same day our story broke, Jan Marsalek — already under the FSB’s protective umbrella following his midnight escape to Belarus in June 2020 — had fired off an encrypted message to one of his longtime Bulgarian associates, Orlin Roussev. Roussev had facilitated many of Marsalek’s “private security” initiatives back in the Austrian fraudster’s Wirecard days, and — also unbeknownst to me back then — Roussev would now assemble a ragtag band of Bulgarians living in the UK, Austria, and Bulgaria to begin tracking my every move. On Dec. 14, 2020, the plot began.\n[The exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev are presented unedited and appear in their original form.]\nAnd so, their operation began in earnest.\nInside Russia, the FSB questioned telecom operators, struggling to understand who had leaked the phone and travel data of its agents — the very data we’d published in our Navalny investigation. Meanwhile, Marsalek convinced the FSB to outsource the “hands-on” legwork of surveilling me around the world to him, and he, in turn, outsourced it to Roussev. The result was befuddling, a spy operation equal parts horrifying and hilarious — more befitting a low-budget rip-off of Ocean’s Eleven than a James Bond film.\nRoussev and Marsalek put together a team of bumbling wannabe spies that included a forty-something blood-bank ambulance driver, his girlfriend who worked as an assistant at a medical lab, a beautician boasting the Ms. Eye Lashes title in addition to running the Pretty Woman parlor in London, a home decorator who once dated the beautician, and a one-time MMA fighter.\nNone had the skill set or background for the espionage missions they were generously tasked with carrying out. And yet they all enjoyed Roussev’s confidence, along with his readiness to forgive their many blunders — and cover for them when reporting back to Marsalek. Perhaps most importantly of all, they had the right kind of passports to travel freely around Europe. They were not Russian, and thus would be more likely to remain unnoticed by their targets.\nWhat few people realized at the time was that in their efforts to track me down, Marsalek had also enlisted the help of his Austrian cronies, who he had bribed into becoming his personal spies. And unlike the Bulgarian bunch, they were professionals. \nOne of them was Martin Weiss, a former senior officer in Austria’s BVT intelligence service who had been in charge of counter-terrorism until 2015. By then, Marsalek was already deeply linked with Russian intelligence, and Weiss had been part of Marsalek’s network of influence long before he left his job at BVT.\nAt the time of the Navalny investigation I was living in Vienna, and the FSB needed some help from a man on the ground. Weiss did not exactly fit the profile, as he had defected to Dubai following the unravelling of the Wirecard scam, in which he stood charged with helping Marsalek flee from justice. However, Weiss had his own network of spies on the ground in Vienna.\nOn Dec. 15, 2020 — the day after we published the Navalny investigation – Weiss messaged a former subordinate, Egisto Ott, who was then working at the Austrian Police Academy. Weiss instructed him to “find out everything about this guy Grozev” and sent him a link to my investigation, published on the Bellingcat website. Several hours later, Ott replied with the puzzled message, “Who is GROZEV?” Weiss replied: “A former CIA employee. Now works freelance.”\nI will never know for certain if this lurid fantasy — obviously transmitted to Weiss by the FSB via Marsalek — was something the Russian security services actually believed in, or whether they merely pretended to do so. Years later I had a chance to pose this question to the Russian spymaster who had originally recruited Jan Marsalek. He matter-of-factly replied: “You must understand. Some people can sleep better if they believe that it’s the CIA, and not some lone journalist, that made them look stupid.”\nA few days after that exchange between the two Austrians, Vladimir Putin publicly dismissed our Navalny revelations as nothing more than “materials furnished to so-called journalists by U.S. intelligence.” It was an odd echo of that sleep-improving self-delusion, broadcast straight from the Kremlin. In retrospect, I now wonder if Marsalek’s recruiter had had Putin in mind when he told me that.\nIn the weeks that followed, we had followed up on the Navalny investigation with several more shocking exposes disclosing that the FSB had tailed and poisoned many other opposition figures in Russia, including opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza (twice) and the poet Dmitry Bykov, and that they had likely poisoned and killed an anti-corruption activist and several independence crusaders from the Caucasus.\nOn Jan. 30, 2021, the FSB made both me and Roman “official targets of surveillance” — as we later learned from a leaked database containing the names of over two million Russians who had popped up on the radar of the security service. Roman, who was then still based in Moscow, was visibly surveilled in the streets and was harassed repeatedly at the airport whenever he would travel in or out of the country.\nInitially, the FSB was mainly interested in getting its hands on our equipment, presumably in the hopes of confirming its hypothesis regarding our links with the CIA. On the evening of March 6, FSB officers stopped Roman at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport after his return from a business trip. Under the cringily absurd pretext of “questioning him about the COVID-19 situation in Europe” — part of an allegedly random survey of travelers arriving from the region — they directed him into a separate room. The officials claimed that border guards were not permitted to bring gadgets into their office, and so Roman’s electronic devices were placed on a table in the hallway. After several ridiculous questions about the reputation of the Russian-made Sputnik vaccine in Europe, Roman suddenly decided to check and see if his belongings were still outside the door, and the interrogator had no time to stop him. He found that neither the laptop nor the mobile phones remained on the table. The FSB officers feigned surprise and promised to return the missing items immediately but succeeded in doing so only after 40 minutes had passed. Although they failed to bypass the pin codes on the phones or computer, the Kremlin’s agents did manage to install a tracker on Roman’s laptop, which he discovered within minutes. Hence, the only damage inflicted was the cost of a new device.\nI had a weirdly similar experience shortly thereafter, not in Moscow, but — shockingly — in Berlin. Flying back from a screening of Navalny in New York and on the way to another one in the Hague, I was just passing via the German capital for a few hours to speak at a conference. The event was held at a pompous hotel in the city’s suburbs. The bellboy insisted on taking my suitcase and laptop bag, even though I protested that I would be in and out in less than an hour. Ultimately I made the mistake of relinquishing my suitcase to his insistent pull. During the event, I looked up the ownership of the hotel only to discover it was owned by a German, quite literally, “friend of Vladimir Putin”. I rushed out to get my suitcase, and the bellboy took a whopping twenty minutes to find it. On the way to the airport, I discovered a hard disk was missing from the suticase. I alerted the police who rushed to the hotel, only to be told that the security cameras had been down for maintenance.\nBack in Vienna, my hometown at the time, I fell outside the FSB’s immediate reach — even if Egisto Ott was able to furnish the Russians with my home address, which he illegally looked up in Austrian police databases. This is why Marsalek’s Bulgarian spies had to be dispatched to surveil me. Their initial plan sounded straightforward: follow me, gain access to my phone or computer, and see if they could reconstruct how The Insider, Bellingcat, and Der Spiegel had unmasked the FSB’s expansive assassination operations.\nIn reality, their operation came off like bad fan fiction, albeit with some seriously close calls for me and my family — and, as it turns out, some scary moments for random bystanders who were misidentified as being linked to me.  \nThe surveillance team rented an Airbnb across the street from my Vienna address, set up a constant surveillance camera to film me coming and going, and even bribed a corrupt employee of Swissport in order to gain access to airline booking data, thereby allowing them not only to know in advance when and where Roman and I were traveling, but also to place their agents next to us on flights. They used actual spy glasses to record me getting in and out of the plane — and even to spy on Roman texting me from inside the cabin. \nWhenever they failed — often enough, they still lost track of me altogether — Roussev spun it to Marsalek as proof of my “advanced tradecraft.” Whenever his spies approached me at a hotel lobby bar, for example, “Grozev stops talking and folds his laptop and walks away.”\n“He’s a paranoid guy,” retorted Marsalek, as if the more normal behaviour would be to let oneself be ostentatiously listened to by strangers. In another incident, they reported a “break-in” at my hotel room that they had achieved by allegedly cloning my key card. “He will never know, as any investigation will show that the room was accessed with his own key.” In truth, they entered someone else’s room to find a sleeping stranger, and instead of acknowledging their failure, the report to Marsalek claimed that, “We found a man sleeping in his bed.”\nBy the middle of 2022, after gathering little to no intelligence of value on me, Marsalek became increasingly exasperated with Roussev and his team, writing that, “Our FSB friends are desperate to prove Grozev is linked to Mi6.” On July 22, he and Roussev had the following exchange:\nThat week, I was spending time with my family at our summer house north of Varna on Bulgaria’s Black Sea coast, and Roussev reported with pride that his team had located my villa — an achievement that would have required nothing more than a peek into the publicly accessible real estate registry. He sent a satellite photo of what was presumably my property, and Marsalek responded: “are you sure this is his house? Google maps are notoriously imprecise for this part of the world.” Roussev responded that he did not depend on Google Maps but on actual “local intelligence.”\nThis resulted in Roussev’s team staking out — and proudly sending photos of — a house that not only was not mine, but was not even in the same holiday settlement. Not surprisingly, when the group bribed a cleaning lady to penetrate “my” villa, they found “only women’s clothes and items,” which they naturally attributed to my superb talents of subterfuge and counter-surveillance.  \nAnother time, the group bragged about having penetrated my Vienna apartment and cracking a “safe.” I have never owned a safe there, but the team likely did succeed in making off with an ancient laptop that had once been used by a deceased relative. They passed this off to Marsalek as a treasure trove of “USB sticks and valuable data.” Roussev’s message to Marsalek describing the very special operation read:\nWeeks later, Marsalek scolded Roussev, telling him that “Our friends at Lubyanka cracked the laptop; little of value there, the freshest files are from 2016.”\nIn order to come off looking at least a little bit more professional, Roussev constantly invented non-existent successes and reported them to Marsalek. He fictitiously claimed that they had recruited a hotel concierge or a stewardess. He even wrote that Vanya Gaberova had achieved incredible success in seducing me, that I had already been “hooked,” that I was falling in love with her and actively liking her photos on Facebook. Not only was I not aware of Gaberova’s existence, but the very idea of me liking any photo on Facebook fills me with cringe. (Upon reviewing my Facebook history following her arrest, however, I did discover that I had accepted her friend request — but only after she had already “befriended” my sister, cousin, classmate and two colleagues.)\nMarsalek, in turn, shared information with Roussev of roughly the same quality, telling him, for example, that the United States was allegedly paying the director of Austrian intelligence a million euros a year for my “personal expenses.” It is unlikely that Marsalek made this up himself; it is more likely that he got the rumor from his FSB handlers, who were tasked with finding my connection to the CIA. Yet at the same time, Roussev wondered why I had such old and tattered shoes. “Strange guy,” Marsalek replied. “Really hard to judge. He might also simply not care or cultivate the image of an honest and down to earth man.” In reality, I simply paid little attention to the choice of footwear for a brief trip to the store, but if I had known I was being followed, I certainly would have worn my good pair.\nThroughout this period, Bulgarian operatives were also tailing Roman across a range of European cities. On July 27, 2021 he had purchased plane tickets, planning to attend a conference in Tbilisi on July 28, followed by a visit to see me in Bulgaria. However, Roman’s itinerary was disrupted before the trip could even begin.\nAt 6 a.m. on July 28, the FSB broke down the door of Roman’s Moscow apartment and searched him. The security services took all the gadgets they could find along with both of his passports. The formal pretext behind the break-in stemmed from an old tweet in which Roman had alleged that Dutch blogger Max van der Werff was working for the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency. The blogger had filed a defamation lawsuit in December 2020, but the police declined to pursue Roman at the time. However, in June 2021, the FSB secretly reopened the case and used it to justify the July 28 search.\nRoman was not arrested, but the FSB was confident that the object of their surveillance would not go anywhere, as his passports had been taken as “material evidence” in the investigation. But Roman took the FSB’s attempt to keep him in the country as a clear sign that he should leave immediately. Two days later, as I played DJ at a children’s karaoke party at my summer apartment in Bulgaria, I helped coordinate Roman’s crossing of the Russian-Ukrainian border through a forest.\nAs Roman awaited new documents, I met him in Western Ukraine for a hike in the Carpathian Mountains. Later on, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) informed Roman that Kyiv’s intelligence services had gathered information showing that a Ukrainian criminal group had received an “order” from Moscow to kidnap him and take him to Russia. A reward of $50,000 was offered for his capture. But the bandits failed to find him, and on Aug. 30, he left for Vienna.\nFrom there, Roman zigzagged around Europe while the spies kept tabs on him via hacked Amadeus flight records. At one point, one of them even booked a seat next to him on a flight from Budapest to Berlin, wearing a hidden camera to record his screen while he texted me. Their attempt to get his smartphone pin code was off by only one digit.\nTheir biggest “coup,” at least in their view, came when they stole a spare phone I had brought along to a conference in Montenegro. They pried it open and found…nothing. I used it precisely because it contained no data of value. Still, they seemed to think it was a gem. They also snapped a photo of Roman and me in our bathing suits on a beach — hardly the stuff of 007-level espionage.\nYet the further their mission drifted from success, the darker their ideas became. \nIn early February 2022 they discovered that I was flying to Kyiv. The group at first intended to follow me, but Marsalek stopped them, hinting that the Russian secret services had their own plans: “Our friends are worried [our] presence might interfere with another overlapping operation in Ukraine. They would prefer if we’d abstain from any on the ground activity in Ukraine at the moment. I don’t know what they are doing but it involves Grozev and his meetings in Ukraine. Maybe he only needs a one-way ticket.”\nI would later learn that, by July 2022, they were actively discussing my potential abduction should I venture back to Bulgaria, and they were also discussing the possibly grabbing Roman and whisking him off of Britain’s eastern coast. The half-baked plans ranged from forcibly drugging and bundling us onto private planes to horrifying fantasies about burning us alive or dousing us with chemicals. As Marsalek noted: “A successful operation in Britain would have been very convenient after the Skripal failure.”\nRoussev wrote that the police had very poor control of the UK’s east coast, which is why the area was frequently being taken advantage of by illegal migrants. “Dobrokhotov would be an illegal migrant in reverse!” — quipped Marsalek. They worked out a detailed plan that would involve several men — including former MMA fighter Ivan Stoyanov — in a violent attack. The scheme was replete with cars bearing fake license plates, a route that avoided traffic surveillance cameras, and two speed boats that would need to be sunk at the end of the operation.\nThe idea was to hand over Roman to the Russian security services, but Marsalek was worried about the logistics: “The problem is how to pick him up in international waters. I'm not sure the guys here would trust our abilities enough to put us in command of a submarine.”\nThe perpetrators also discussed a possible alternative: assassination. Roussev suggested staging an “accident in the shower,” but Marsalek dismissed the idea as insufficiently dramatic: “Maybe burn him alive in the street, spray him with some super strong acid, VX, like the North Koreans, or ricin .... An accident in the shower won't deter others. We need more drama!”\nThankfully, even the FSB seemed wary of such outlandish schemes. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 raised global tensions to a fever pitch. However vengeful the Kremlin felt after our Navalny exposure — and about our subsequent investigations — it seemed less willing to risk a full-blown scandal on foreign soil.\nBy late 2022, the Kremlin officially declared me “wanted” in connection with aiding Roman’s efforts to “illegally cross the Russian border.” The accusation was absurd, given that Roman had left, rather than entered, the country. Still, Marsalek took it as a sign the FSB might get “legal” grounds for our extradition. His text messages to Roussev were chilling. \nOne of Marsalek’s ideas about my own liquidation sounded like a film-noir fantasy. “Let’s hire an ISIS suicide bomber and have him blow himself next to Grozev in the street.” Another fantasy was more appropriate for a Mission Impossible film: I would be kidnapped by boat to Syria, while someone wearing a latex mask with my face would fly to Moscow to get arrested on camera.\nBefore they could attempt any new gambit, however, British authorities moved in. In January 2023, law enforcement raided the group’s makeshift operations base, discovering forged IDs, hidden cameras, listening devices, and a mass of incriminating messages tying them directly to Marsalek — and by extension, to the FSB. Under the weight of this evidence, two of the six suspects turned state’s witness. By mid-February 2023, their Old Bailey trial ended with a small measure of justice: unanimous guilty verdicts.\nThe criminals' fake journalist IDs.\nRoussev's room filled with spy equipment.\nHidden camera seized during the arrest.\nHidden camera seized during the arrest.\nWhile the operation’s comedic misfires bordered on farce, its true gravity is unmistakable. The same FSB unit behind Navalny’s poisoning was, through Marsalek and his overseas recruits, now hunting me and Roman — journalists who had exposed one of their darkest secrets. Marsalek, the flamboyant ex-financier, remained the linchpin abroad, leveraging an unwitting cast of amateurs for tasks that escalated from laptop theft to potential murder.\nRoman and I are still continuing our investigative work in undisclosed locations, keenly aware that the Kremlin’s reach can be disturbingly long. The verdicts handed down by the Old Bailey have put an end to this particular plot, but Marsalek himself remains at large — as we now know — under Moscow’s protection. If there’s one sobering lesson I’ve taken from this ordeal, it’s that every time a thwarted plan for retribution fizzles, another one may appear. We live and work in the shadow of a Kremlin that abhors pesky truth-tellers — and from my vantage point, it will take more than one guilty verdict to change that.\nWe really need your help!

Nach Angaben des russischen Außenministeriums in Moskau enttarnte der Inlandsgeheimdienst FSB eine nicht angemeldete Geheimdienstpräsenz unter dem Deckmantel der britischen Botschaft. \n\nDie Regierung in London wies die Vorwürfe zurück. «Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Russland bösartige und grundlose Beschuldigungen gegen unsere Mitarbeiter erhoben hat», sagte ein Sprecher des Außenministeriums.\n\nBetroffen sind nach russischen Angaben der zweite Sekretär der Botschaft und der Ehemann der ersten Sekretärin der politischen Abteilung. Ein Vertreter der britischen Botschaft wurde demnach ins Außenministerium einbestellt.\n\nDie beiden Briten sollen laut FSB falsche Angaben im Antrag für ihre Einreiseerlaubnis gemacht haben. Gleichzeitig seien Anzeichen für nachrichtendienstliche und umstürzlerische Tätigkeiten dieser Diplomaten festgestellt worden, die die Sicherheit Russlands bedrohten. Deswegen habe das Außenministerium ihnen die Akkreditierungen entzogen und sie zur Ausreise aufgefordert. Sie müssen das Land innerhalb von zwei Wochen verlassen. \n\nMoskau und London streiten immer wieder über Diplomaten und angebliche Spionage. Seit Beginn des von Kremlchef Wladimir Putin befohlenen Angriffskriegs auf die Ukraine sind die Beziehungen zwischen Russland und Großbritannien zusätzlich angespannt. Anfang Februar erreichte der Streit mit der Eröffnung eines Strafverfahrens eine neue Eskalationsstufe. Ein mutmaßlich britischer Diplomat soll eine Frau gestoßen haben, deswegen werde wegen Körperverletzung ermittelt, hieß es damals.\n\nIn einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland waren zudem vergangene Woche in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden.

Sie wurde automatisch von der Deutschen Presse-Agentur (dpa) übernommen.\nDie kleine Münchner Immobilienbank Obotritia ist nach jahrelangen Schwierigkeiten endgültig pleite: Das Amtsgericht in der Landeshauptstadt hat das Insolvenzverfahren eröffnet, wie die Finanzaufsicht Bafin mitteilte. Die Kunden sollen zumindest einen Teil ihrer Gelder schnell zurückbekommen. Da das Geldinstitut laut Finanzaufsicht Bafin nicht mehr in der Lage ist, die Einlagen von gut 1.300 verbliebenen Anlagern zurückzuzahlen, hat die Behörde den sogenannten «Entschädigungsfall» festgestellt. Das bedeutet, dass die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung einspringt und die Ansprüche prüft. Pro Kunde sind im Regelfall maximal 100.000 Euro Rückzahlung möglich, in Ausnahmefällen auch mehr. \n\nDie Bankhaus Obotritia GmbH war bereits in Liquidation, die Bafin hatte den Insolvenzantrag in der vergangenen Woche gestellt. Vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter ist der Rechtsanwalt Michael Jaffé, der seit 2020 auch die restlichen Vermögenswerte des zusammengebrochenen Wirecard-Konzerns sichert. Die Bank hatte erst 2019 die Geschäfte aufgenommen und war laut Bafin hauptsächlich im Bereich Gewerbeimmobilien tätig - ein Sektor, der im Zuge der Corona-Pandemie in die Krise rutschte.\n\nDer Banken-Bundesverband erklärte, dass die Entschädigungseineinrichtung der deutschen Banken (EdB) sich «umgehend und unaufgefordert» mit den Einlegern in Verbindung setzen werde. Obotritia war demnach jedoch nicht Mitglied des Bankenverbands und daher auch nicht an dessen freiwilligen Einlagensicherungsfonds beteiligt, der die gesetzliche EdB ergänzt.\n\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250310-930-399508/1\n\n\n            Hier können Sie interessante Artikel speichern, um sie später zu lesen und wiederzufinden.\n        \n\n            Sie haben bereits ein Konto?\n            Hier anmelden."

Im\nKapitalanleger-Musterverfahren können keine Schadensersatzansprüche\ngegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY vorgebracht werden, teilte\nGerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt mit. \n\nAuf Schadensersatz\ngeklagt haben nach Angaben der Richterin mittlerweile knapp 8.700 Anleger.\nWeitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. Ihre Ansprüche richten sich vor allem gegen die Prüfungsgesellschaft EY, die über Jahre falsche Bilanzen von Wirecard gebilligt haben soll. \n\nIn Musterverfahren gebündelt\nwerden können laut Schmidt nur Klagen wegen falscher Information des Kapitalmarkts. Gemeint\nsind damit unter anderem falsche Bilanzen und falsche Pflichtmitteilungen an\ndie Börse. EY hat jedoch\nnach Argumentation des Senats die falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen inklusive des\nEY-Bestätigungsvermerks nicht selbst veröffentlicht, sondern Wirecard.\nInsofern sind Schadensersatzansprüche gegen EY im Musterverfahren laut Gericht \"nicht statthaft\". \n\nMusterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil nannte die\nEntscheidung \"hundertprozentig falsch\". Er kündigte Beschwerde beim\nBundesgerichtshof an.  \n\nDie\nEntscheidung des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts bedeutet nicht, dass Wirecard-Aktionäre\ngrundsätzlich nicht gegen EY klagen können. Doch Grundlage muss nach Worten\nder Richterin die \"Verletzung von Prüfpflichten\" sein, nicht die falsche\nInformation des Kapitalmarkts. Schadensersatzansprüche gegen den Ex-Vorstandschef Markus Braun und weitere frühere Wirecard-Größen werden\nlaut Schmidt in dem Musterverfahren weiter verhandelt.  \n\nTschüss, Finanzchaos: In acht Wochen erklären wir Schritt für Schritt, wie Sie bessere Geldroutinen aufbauen und das mit den ETFs endlich angehen.

Nun entschied der erste Zivilsenat des Gerichts, dass im angefochtenen Zeitraum das Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz keine SchadensersatzansprÃ¼che gegen den AbschlussprÃ¼fer ergibt.Â \nDie KlÃ¤ger vertreten die Auffassung, dass EY gegen seine PrÃ¼fpflichten verstoÃen habe. Das Gericht entschied, das Kapitalanlagen-Musterverfahren kÃ¶nne nicht angewendet werden, weil Wirecard und nicht die WirtschaftsprÃ¼fer den Kapitalmarkt Ã¼ber die Erteilung uneingeschrÃ¤nkter BestÃ¤tigungsvermerke Ã¼ber die PrÃ¼fung der KonzernabschlÃ¼sse und Konzernlageberichte der Jahre 2014 bis 2018 unterrichtet habe.\nZahlreiche weitere Feststellungsziele des Landgerichts wies der Senat als unzulÃ¤ssig zurÃ¼ck, da sie zu unbestimmt seien - andere, weil es kein RechtsschutzbedÃ¼rfnis gebe. Gegen diesen Teil-Musterbescheid kann Beschwerde zum Bundesgerichtshof eingelegt werden.Â \nDer Zivilsenat des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts muss nun im weiteren Verfahren Ã¼ber die Zulassung von zahlreichen ErweiterungsantrÃ¤gen entscheiden.Â \nWirecard galt einst als deutscher HoffnungstrÃ¤ger und seine Aktie als gute Investition. Doch die Chefetage des MÃ¼nchner Unternehmens soll Ã¼ber Jahre ScheingeschÃ¤fte in MilliardenhÃ¶he verbucht und den Umsatz so immer weiter kÃ¼nstlich aufgeblÃ¤ht haben. So schaffte es das Unternehmen in den Dax. Ende Juni 2020 meldete Wirecard dann Insolvenz an. Tausende Anlegerinnen und Anleger verloren viel Geld.\nBei dem Unternehmen selbst ist nichts mehr zu holen. Die klagenden Anleger hofften insbesondere auf die Wirtschaftskraft von EY, um an Geld zu kommen.Â \nDas Musterverfahren bÃ¼ndelt rund 8500 entsprechende Klagen. Allein aus diesen Verfahren ergibt sich eine geforderte EntschÃ¤digungssumme von rund 750 Millionen Euro. Hinzu kommen weitere rund 19.000 Anlegerinnen und Anleger, die kein eigenes Verfahren eingeleitet, sich aber dem Musterverfahren angeschlossen haben.\nstern+ und Klassik Radio Selectstatt 11,96 â¬ nur 1 â¬ \n2 Monate Klassik Radio Select geschenkt mit 180 Musiksendern\n\nBereits registriert?\nHier anmelden"

Ein Gericht in London verurteilt sie dafür. Das Strafmaß folgt noch. Im Prozess spielt ein gesuchter, mutmaßlicher Spion des Kreml eine Rolle: Jan Marsalek. \nIn einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland sind in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden. Sie handelten mutmaßlich im Auftrag von Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Jan Marsalek, wie die Nachrichtenagentur PA meldete. Ihnen drohen Haftstrafen von bis zu 14 Jahren. Das Strafmaß soll noch verkündet werden. \n\"Das war Spionage im industriellen Stil für Russland\", sagte der Anti-Terror-Chef der Londoner Polizei, Dominic Murphy. Es seien Beweismittel in dem Maße gefunden worden, wie man sie eigentlich in einem Spionageroman erwarten würde. \nVor Gericht waren zudem romantische Dreiecksbeziehungen innerhalb der Spionagegruppe Thema. Eine der Angeklagten sollte als sogenannte Honigfalle für einen bekannten Russland-kritischen Journalisten eingesetzt werden, im Versteck des Spionagerings wurden Video- und Tonaufnahmegeräte in Alltagsgegenständen gefunden.\nDer Chef des Ringes sowie sein Stellvertreter hatten im vergangenen November die Spionage für Russland eingeräumt. Beide stammen ebenfalls aus Bulgarien, auch für sie steht das Strafmaß noch nicht fest. Zudem soll es Entführungspläne gegeben haben.\nMarsalek soll als Vermittler zwischen dem russischen Geheimdienst und dem Anführer der Gruppe in Großbritannien gehandelt haben. Der Ex-Wirecard-Vertriebsvorstand ist seit der Pleite des ehemaligen Dax-Konzerns untergetaucht und wird in Russland vermutet. In dem Londoner Prozess war Marsalek nicht selbst angeklagt. Zitiert wurden etliche Textnachrichten, die von dem Österreicher stammen sollen.\nEs sei eine extrem ausgeklügelte Geheimdienstoperation gewesen, die eine Bedrohung für die nationale Sicherheit und für Einzelpersonen dargestellt habe, sagte Murphy. Wäre die Gruppe nicht verhaftet worden, hätten letztlich Menschenleben auf dem Spiel stehen können, wie es beim Nowitschok-Anschlag 2018 in Salisbury der Fall gewesen sei. Damals war der übergelaufene russische Agent Sergej Skripal mit dem Nervenkampfstoff Nowitschok vergiftet worden.\nDie Angeklagten im Alter von 43, 30 und 39 Jahren sollen Personen und Orte ausgespäht oder geplant haben, das zu tun, die für Russland interessant sind. In Deutschland seien das etwa eine Luftwaffenbasis sowie eine nicht näher genannte Botschaft gewesen. Die Spione waren im Februar 2023 verhaftet worden.\nDie Spionageaktivitäten sollen in London sowie in Stuttgart, Wien, Valencia und dem Balkanstaat Montenegro stattgefunden haben. Dafür hätten die Angeklagten beträchtliche Geldsummen erhalten, hatte die Staatsanwältin im Verlauf des Prozesses gesagt. Sky News zufolge wurden bei der Razzia im Versteck unter anderem 495 SIM-Karten, 221 Telefone, 258 Festplatten und 11 Drohnen gefunden.\nQuelle: ntv.de, als/dpa"

            "full_content": "Jens Lehmann sollte am Montag (24. März) vor Gericht stehen. Mal wieder. Warum? Weil er mit dem Handy am Steuer erwischt wurde – und dagegen Einspruch einlegte. Mehr zu den Skandalen von Jens Lehmann erfahren Sie hier.\nDie Staatsanwältin fordert einen Punkt in Flensburg für den Keeper. Zudem gibt es ein Bußgeld von 100 Euro. Doch um 8.55 Uhr war vom ehemaligen Torwart der Nationalmannschaft im Amtsgericht München keine Spur, wie „bild.de“ berichtet. \nAmtsgericht-Sprecher Dr. Martin Swoboda sagt auf Anfrage des Mediums: „In dem heutigen Termin stellte das Gericht fest, dass der Betroffene trotz ordnungsgemäßer Ladung ohne genügende Entschuldigung nicht erschienen ist. Eine Entbindung von der Verpflichtung zum Erscheinen war nicht erfolgt.“\nAuch die Richterin nutzt das Fehlen von Lehmann für einen Witz: „Er hätte ja ein Taxi oder einen Hubschrauber nehmen können.“ \nDas Taxi bezieht sich darauf, dass Lehmann unter Alkoholeinfluss eine Fahrt ohne Führerschein machte und besser ein Taxi genommen hätte. Auch bei der Alkohol-Fahrt legte Lehmann Einspruch ein. Der Helikopter darauf, dass er einst als Torwart des VfB Stuttgart eben diesen benutzt hat, um vom Starnberger See zum Training zu kommen. Die Strecke beträgt rund 250 Kilometer.\nZwar legte Lehmann gegen den Punkt in Flensburg Einspruch ein, zur Verhandlung erschien er nicht. Auch sein Anwalt war laut „bild.de“ nicht vor Ort. Somit hat das Gericht den Einspruch verworfen. Lehmann kann innerhalb einer Woche jedoch noch Rechtsmittel gegen das Urteil einlegen.\nZuletzt hatte Jens Lehmann wegen Wirecard sehr viel Geld verloren.\nNBAE via Getty Images, imago images/Lackovic, dpa2, imago images/ZUMA Wire, © 2021 SID, AFP/GETTY IMAGES/SID/ANDREW D.

            "full_content": "Forbes Councils Member. \nNuala Walsh is MindEquity CEO, adjunct professor of behavioral science, non-exec director & author of TUNE IN: How to Make Smart Decisions \nAre you too trusting? Do you tend to believe what you’re told? Almost 80 million consumers in the U.S. have been scammed within the last five years—including many smart professionals. Fake debt advice and friend-in-need scams are profitable businesses.\nBut it’s not just external duplicity that affects us. Even smart people ignore red flags, trust easily and hear what they want. In the workplace, do you turn a deaf ear to what really matters? A Washington University study concurred that when autonomous team members trusted each other, active monitoring reduced. As a result, each had lower awareness of the others’ activities, adversely affecting performance.\nOur brains are wired to trust in ways that can be both an asset and a liability. As a behavioral scientist and board advisor, I have found that knowing the psychology behind this tendency can help us avoid falling into the traps of naivete and victimhood.\nA meta-analysis of 206 legal cases with 24,483 judges indicated that people spot deception just over half the time. That’s not surprising! When we are poor lie detectors, we get easily duped and are vulnerable to misinformation.\nOne reason for gullibility is that we accept things at face value. We believe what we hear, especially when we aspire to promotion or even board appointments.\nThe reality is also quite practical. We’re easily fooled because we simply haven’t got time to perform a due diligence on every pitch, prospect or presentation. Busy people resist reflection. According to a 2022 Kings College London report, 47% of respondents claimed that deep thinking has \"become a thing of the past.” That’s a mistake.\nAs I've shared in my book TUNE IN: How to Make Smarter Decisions in a Noisy World, we follow predictable patterns of thinking thanks to what I call selective bias \"deaf spots\"—the cousins of blind spots. Some of these biases amplify the risk of overtrust, including authority bias, relationship bias and the halo effect.\nWith authority bias, we trust experts in positions of power at the expense of critical thinking. The automatic \"default to truth\" goes beyond hierarchical obedience; sometimes, employees suspect malpractice but turn a convenient deaf ear.\nFor instance, Silicon Valley darling Theranos promised revolutionary blood-testing technology. Investors trusted former CEO Elizabeth Holmes with millions. Employees feared her autocratic style as she fired dissenters. The Wall Street Journal reported she dismissed Walgreen’s concerns by saying, \"They don't put pretty people like me in jail.\" Eventually, the operation was exposed as a fraud. But this fraud was not possible without complicity.\nRelationships can further influence our trust. The longer you’re in partnership, the more you assume trust. For instance, EY audited Wirecard for a decade yet failed to uncover a €1.9 billion fraud that led to one of Europe’s biggest financial scandals—and Wirecard’s collapse.\nAmbitious executives are known to manipulate the trust of colleagues for personal gain. Office politics, backstabbing, silent whispers and pejorative rumors can all be used to get ahead.\nMisplaced perceptions are also judgement killers. The \"halo effect\" is when we assume that because someone excels in one discipline, they’re just as skilled in others. Consider how former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann charmed investors and employees with his vision, despite unsustainable business practices.\nThese deaf spots partly explain why even experienced professionals fall into misjudgement traps—and why businesses suffer as a result.\nWhile trust can fuel collaboration and foster innovation, many don’t realize the darker side of over-trust until it’s too late. When well-intended team members assume competence in their lieutenants, place unwavering faith in authority, or ignore warning signs, they risk catastrophic failures like fraud, misconduct and destroyed shareholder value. The media write about the consequences every day.\nFortunately, there are several ways to avoid falling victim to the risk of placing too much trust in narratives, scams and office politics:\nLeaders should invite, not suppress, tough questions. In the same vein, make sure your employees feel comfortable challenging leadership on assumptions without fear of backlash. To reduce blind trust in authority, Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates model a policy of “radical transparency” and open confrontation to ensure company decisions are consistently questioned.\nTrust should be earned through accountability rather than merely assumed by virtue of position. Internal audits, whistleblower protections and oversight teams can help prevent trust from being turned into blind faith.\nAt Boeing, employees described the development of the 737 MAX as \"frenetic\" and an \"intense pressure cooker,\" but competitive pressure from Airbus kept scrutiny at bay—until tragic crashes exposed the design flaws. Their post-crisis reforms now include stricter independent reviews.\nYour employees should be able to voice concerns about workplace issues and safety without fear of being dismissed, degraded or punished as a result. At Uber, employees trusted the aggressive, growth-first culture under Travis Kalanick, yet it led to ethical scandals, expensive lawsuits and resignations.\nMeanwhile, Google’s now infamous Project Aristotle found that safety was the #1 factor in high-performing teams. In my own experience, when people speak up, it’s initially uncomfortable but can help ensure that the business makes better decisions.\nBiases unconsciously distort trust. Consider using interactive sessions to identify vulnerable situations where team members may trust too easily—for example, when under pressure, in crisis, or dealing with resource scarcity. When I worked in investment management, many dismissed behavioral science training as a means to prevent overconfidence. That’s no longer the case.\nGood judgement is getting harder in today’s scam-friendly world. But I have found that trust isn’t the enemy—naivete is. There’s a fine line, and walking it requires balancing confidence with verification and belief with critical thinking.\nRonald Reagan once said, “trust but verify.” While true, I would suggest that \"distrust but verify\" is a much smarter approach for today's leaders.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Nu se știe unde se află Jan Marsalek în prezent, însă se crede că este în Rusia, de unde ar fi condus rețeaua de spionaj.\nFinancial Times relata într-un material din aprilie 2024 că Marsalek s-ar fi folosit de funcționari compromiși din serviciile secrete austriece pentru a spiona cetățeni europeni, inclusiv prin baza de date Schengen, și pentru a plănui spargeri și asasinate comise de echipe rusești de elită.\nIvanova, Gaberova și Ivanchev au pledat nevinovați pentru acuzația de conspirație cu scopul de a aduna informații utile inamicului, susținând că nu știau că ajută Rusia.

In den Geschäftszahlen des E-Autobauers scheint es derweil Ungereimtheiten zu geben. Es klafft eine Lücke von 1,4 Milliarden US-Dollar.\nTesla derzeit viele schlechte Nachricht verkraften. Das Unternehmen verliert nicht nur kontinuierlich an Wert, auch in der Fahrzeugproduktion läuft es nicht rund. In den USA muss der E-Autobauer mehr als 46.000 Modelle seines Cybertrucks zurückrufen.\nDabei handelt sich um die Modelle, die zwischen November 2023 und Ende Februar 2025 gebaut wurden – also nahezu alle Cybertrucks, die Tesla bisher in den USA ausgeliefert hat. Grund ist ein Dokument, das der US-Verkehrssicherheitsbehörde NHTSA vorliegt. Demnach sei die stählerne Außenverkleidung nicht richtig befestigt, könne abfallen und so den Straßenverkehr gefährden.\nJeden Tag bekommen 10.000+ Abonnenten die wichtigsten Tech-News direkt in die Inbox. Abonniere jetzt dein kostenloses Tech-Briefing:\nMit deiner Anmeldung bestätigst du unsere Datenschutzerklärung\nDie Rückrufaktion dürfte ein weiteres Loch in die Kassen von Tesla reißen und dem Image der Marke nicht wirklich zuträglich sein. Doch während der Probleme mit dem Cybertruck, gibt es wohl auch Ungereimtheiten in den Geschäftszahlen des US-Konzerns, wie die Financial Times berichtet.\nDem Bericht zufolge gibt es eine enorme Diskrepanz zwischen den Ausgaben bei Tesla und den tatsächlichen Firmenwerten. Denn der US-Konzern hat laut eigenen Angaben im zweiten Halbjahr 2024 6,3 Milliarden US-Dollar in Eigentum und Ausrüstung investiert.\nAllerdings hat der Wert in den Geschäftszahlen von Tesla in diesem Zeitraum nur um 4,9 Milliarden US-Dollar zugenommen. Es fehlen also offenbar 1,4 Milliarden US-Dollar, wie die Financial Times anhand der Statements zum Cashflow von Tesla errechnet hat.\nEin Unterschied zwischen den Werten sei zwar nicht ungewöhnlich. Jedoch handle es sich um eine auffallend große Lücke, die selbst für einen Konzern wie Tesla enorm sei.\nTesla selbst hat sich bis dato noch nicht zu den Berichten geäußert. Allerdings ist es möglich, dass die fehlenden Werte in späteren Geschäftszahlen wieder auftauchen.\nIn Anbetracht der aktuellen finanziellen Situation des Konzerns wirft die Summe jedoch Fragen auf. Ein Experte von der SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences warnte gegenüber der Financial Times, dass es sich um ein Warnsignal handeln könnte. Ähnliche hätte es beispielsweise auch bei Finanzskandalen wie den um Wirecard gegeben.\nDu willst solche Themen nicht verpassen?

La sentencia se dictará previsiblemente en mayo una vez que el jurado del Tribunal Penal Nacional, el renombrado Old Bailey, condenara el viernes por unanimidad a tres miembros de la célula que Scotland Yard desarticuló en febrero de 2023.\nKatrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova y Tihomir Ivanchev eran los peones de una trama de vigilancia, seguimiento, interferencia de móviles, acceso a bases de datos de aerolíneas e intento de secuestro de objetivos de interés para el Kremlin. Fueron contratados por Orlin Roussev, experto en Informática y detective privado de 47 años, que ocupaba un antiguo hotel junto a la playa de Great Yarmouth, localidad del condado de Norfolk, al este de Inglaterra. La Policía se incautó de sofisticados aparatos electrónicos en la residencia costera.\nRoussev y su lugarteniente, Bizer Dzhambazov, se declararon culpables meses atrás ante el caudal de pruebas incriminatorias acumuladas en la investigación policial. El sexto involucrado, Ivan Stoyanov, aceptó su responsabilidad al inicio del juicio contra los tres operarios de bajo rango, que se prolongó casi tres meses.\nRoussev actuaba por orden de Jan Marsalek, empresario austriaco y supuesto espía ruso, que se fugó de Alemania en 2020 tras la quiebra de la gestora de pagos Wirecard, en un fraude de 1.900 millones de euros. Ambos se comunicaban por WhatsApp y, principalmente, por el canal de Telegram, generando un torrente de mensajes que Roussev no borró de su móvil.\nEn una comunicación, Marsalek parece sugerir que el presidente ruso Vladimir Putin estaba al corriente de una misión contra el periodista búlgaro Christo Grozev, quien investigó la complicidad de agentes rusos en el envenenamiento del opositor Alexei Navalny y el intento de asesinato en Inglaterra del ex espía Sergei Skripal y su hija Julia. \"Aparentemente, Putin realmente le odia [a Grozev]\", escribió el jefe de la célula refugiado en Rusia, según ha trascendido de las pesquisas británicas.\nGrozev estuvo en el objetivo de la banda en Valencia. El investigador acudió en 2021 a una conferencia de Bellingcat, la plataforma informativa donde trabajaba, y Dzhambazov se encargó de su vigilancia. El espía se hospedó en el hotel Palace con su colega Gaberova un día antes de la llegada a la ciudad española de su pareja oficial, Katrin Ivanova. Se consumó así el inicio de un triángulo amoroso que ocultó a las dos mujeres, que al parecer se conocieron en la apertura del juicio. El amante compartido también les engañó pretendiendo que se había operado de un cáncer en la cabeza.\nEl jurado no creyó el argumento de ambas mujeres de que fueron manipuladas, engañadas y utilizadas en la trama orquestada en Moscú, dirigida desde Norfolk y puesta en práctica por los operadores ubicados en Londres. \"Esta no será la única actividad que Rusia esté dirigiendo en Reino Unido\", advirtió Dom Murphy, comandante jefe de la División Contraterrorista de Scotland Yard. \nPués en Cataluña hay uno una en cada esquina"

            "full_content": "EY ist der einzige Beteiligte am Wirecard-Skandal, bei dem sich Anleger berechtigte Hoffnungen machen können, dass noch etwas zu holen ist.\nFast 30.000 Anleger blicken gespannt auf die juristische Aufarbeitung des Wirecard-Skandals. Wer könnte für die Verluste haftbar gemacht werden? In einem Musterverfahren entscheidet die Richterin: Gegen die Bilanzprüfer von EY sind keine Ansprüche durchsetzbar. Der Fall kommt vor den BGH.\nEine erste Entscheidung des bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts dämpft im Wirecard-Skandal die Hoffnungen zehntausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz. Im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahren können demnach keine Schadenersatzansprüche gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY vorgebracht werden, die die Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns bis zu dessen Kollaps im Sommer 2020 bestätigt hatten. Das verkündete Gerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt. Musterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil nannte die Entscheidung \"hundertprozentig falsch\" und kündigte Beschwerde beim Bundesgerichtshof an.\nDas zivilrechtliche Musterverfahren vor dem Bayerischen Obersten Landesgericht läuft parallel zum Strafprozess, in dem sich Ex-Vorstandschef Markus Braun und zwei Mitangeklagte seit Dezember 2022 verantworten müssen. Nach Worten der Richterin haben mittlerweile knapp 8700 Anleger auf Schadenersatz geklagt. Weitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. \nAls Musterkläger hat der 1. Zivilsenat quasi stellvertretend einen hessischen Bankkaufmann ausgewählt, der eine halbe Million Euro mit Wirecard-Papieren verloren hat. Eigentliche Zielscheibe der Kläger ist EY: Das Unternehmen ist solvent, während bei Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und Co. nach allgemeiner Einschätzung nichts mehr zu holen ist. \nGerichtspräsidentin Schmidt begründete den \"Teilmusterentscheid\": In Musterverfahren gebündelt werden können nur Klagen wegen falscher Information des Kapitalmarkts. Gemeint sind damit unter anderem falsche Bilanzen und falsche Pflichtmitteilungen an die Börse. EY hat jedoch nach Argumentation des Senats die falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen inklusive des EY-Bestätigungsvermerks nicht selbst veröffentlicht, sondern die Wirecard-Chefetage. Insofern sind Schadenersatzansprüche gegen EY im Musterverfahren laut Gericht \"nicht statthaft\".\nDie Entscheidung bedeutet nicht, dass Wirecard-Aktionäre grundsätzlich nicht gegen EY klagen könnten. Doch Grundlage müsste nach Worten der Richterin die \"Verletzung von Prüfpflichten\" sein, nicht die falsche Information des Kapitalmarkts. Die Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Braun und andere ehemalige Wirecard-Größen werden in dem Musterverfahren ohne Umweg über den BGH weiter verhandelt. \"Es geht weiter\", sagte Schmidt.\nDie Vizepräsidentin der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW), Daniela Bergdolt, betonte, notfalls würden auch Aktionärsansprüche gegen EY in anderen Prozessen geltend gemacht. Ein EY-Sprecher sagte, das Wirtschaftsprüfungsunternehmen bewerte die Schadensersatzklagen nach wie vor als unbegründet. Die Entscheidung des Obersten Landesgerichts nehme man zur Kenntnis.\nDas Verfahren ist eines der umfangreichsten der deutschen Geschichte. Im Hintergrund stehen Aktionärsforderungen von bis zu 8,5 Milliarden Euro. In einem nächsten Schritt ist nun noch umfangreiche Nacharbeit nötig, wie Richterin Schmidt deutlich machte. Sie warf dem Landgericht München wie bereits beim Prozessauftakt im November eine schlampige Vorbereitung vor. Zahlreiche Kernfragen - so genannte Feststellungsziele - seien unpräzise formuliert und deswegen unzulässig. Das Gericht will sich nun mit einem neuen Fragenkatalog befassen, den Klägeranwalt Mattil eingereicht hat.\nDer Dax-Konzern Wirecard brach im Juni 2020 zusammen, als aufflog, dass dem Zahlungsabwickler auf Treuhandkonten in Asien 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlten. Es handelt sich um einen der größten Finanzskandale der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte. Zur Aufarbeitung der Wirecard-Pleite laufen immer noch etliche Gerichtsverfahren. Ex-Wirecard-Chef Braun sitzt wegen eines Betrugsprozesses in Untersuchungshaft und kam heute nicht zu dem Gerichtstermin.\nQuelle: ntv.de, jog/dpa/rts"

            "full_content": "Das Beratungsunternehmen hatte die mutmaßlich falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen abgesegnet. Doch Verantwortung tragen muss es laut einem aktuellen Urteil nicht – zumindest gegenüber den Aktionären.\nDie Causa um Wirecard geht als einer der umfangreichsten Prozesse in die deutsche Justizgeschichte ein. Neben dem strafrechtlichen Bereich um den ehemaligen CEO des einstigen DAX-Fintech, Markus Braun, und weiterer Manager wollen vor allem die geschädigten Aktionäre ihr Geld wiederhaben – zumindest etwas Entschädigung. Doch sie mussten am Freitag eine herbe Enttäuschung hinnehmen. Grund ist ein Urteil des Obersten Landesgerichts in München. \nAktionäre und ihre Anwälte nahmen das Wirtschaftsprüfungsunternehmen Ernst & Young (EY) ins Visier. EY hatte die mutmaßlich falschen Bilanzen von Wirecard abgesegnet. Doch der Gerichtspräsidentin und Senatsvorsitzenden Andrea Schmidt zufolge kann das Unternehmen nicht zur Verantwortung gezogen werden – zumindest nicht in diesem Gerichtsverfahren. Ansprüche können noch immer in anderen Wirecard-Prozessen geltend gemacht werden.\nIn der Begründung heißt es, dass die Testate keine Kapitalmarktinformationen im Sinne des Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetzes (KapMuG) in der alten Fassung seien, auf das sich dieser Prozess jedoch stützt. Der Fokus in diesem Prozess richtet sich nun auf die übrigen Beklagten wie den Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und die von Insolvenzverwaltern vertretenen Firmenreste. Ex-Finanzvorstand Jan Marsalek, ebenfalls Österreicher, ist flüchtig. Bei ihnen wird kaum Vermögen gesehen. Daher rückte EY in den Fokus. Gegen die Entscheidung kann Rechtsbeschwerde eingelegt werden. \nLaut der Kanzlei TILP wurde über die wichtige Frage, ob EY gegenüber Investoren der Wirecard Pflichten verletzt hat, noch nicht entschieden. „Der Teil-Musterentscheid stellt keine Endentscheidung dar, ist jedoch isoliert mit Rechtsbeschwerde zum Bundesgerichtshof anfechtbar“, sagte Rechtsanwalt Martin Kühler. Die Kanzlei sehe daher „sehr gute Ansatzpunkte“ für eine Rechtsbeschwerde.\nIn dem KapMuG-Prozess sollen zahlreiche Kernfragen von 8500 Einzelprozessen geklärt werden, die vor dem deutschen Gericht anhängig sind. Weitere 19.000 Anleger, die nicht vor dem Landgericht klagten, hatten Ansprüche direkt beim Obersten Landesgericht angemeldet. Dahinter stehen Aktionärsforderungen von bis zu 8,5 Milliarden Euro.\nAuch in Österreich meldeten sich Tausende für Sammelklagen und den KapMuG-Prozess an. Hierzulande bleibt die Wertpapierkennnummer (WKN) 747206 eine Zahl, die für einen Multimilliardenverlust steht. Die Wirecard-Aktie hatte seit September 2018 im deutschen Leitindex DAX notiert und sich damit in die 30 größten deutschen Aktiengesellschaften gereiht. Mit der Aufdeckung des Skandals um einen mutmaßlichen Betrug wurde die Aktie wertlos. In Österreich liegt die Schadenssumme im Schnitt bei 37.500 Euro je Kläger. \nDer Wirecard-Konzern brach im Juni 2020 zusammen, als aufflog, dass dem Zahlungsabwickler auf Treuhandkonten in Asien 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlten. Es handelt sich um einen der größten Finanzskandale der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte. Zur Aufarbeitung der Wirecard-Pleite laufen immer noch etliche Gerichtsverfahren. Derzeit sitzt Braun wegen Betrugs in Untersuchungshaft und kam am Freitag nicht zu dem Gerichtstermin."

Il gruppo avrebbe anche discusso di rapimenti o uccisioni di oppositori dello stato russo.\nI connazionali dei tre, Orlin Roussev, 47 anni e Biser Dzhambazov, 43, avevano già ammesso di aver compiuto reati di spionaggio, come anche un sesto imputato, Ivan Stoyanov, 34 anni, la cui condanna è stata resa nota venerdì 7 marzo. Entrambe le donne avevano una relazione con Dzhambazov, che dirigeva le operazioni sul territorio delle spie. La rete di spionaggio era gestita da Roussev, un ex dipendente del Comune.\nSecondo il tribunale britannico i condannati avevano spiato fra l’altro Christo Grozev, giornalista bulgaro anti-Cremlino di Bellingcat e Roman Dobrokhotov, giornalista e dissidente russo rifugiatosi nel Regno, dove ha fondato il sito The Insider. Il loro lavoro includeva la denuncia del ruolo della Russia negli attacchi con agenti nervini contro il leader dell’opposizione russa Alexei Navalny nel 2020. Le spie avrebbero anche cercato di attirare in una storia d’amore trappola con Gaberova, una giornalista bulgara che aveva scoperto il coinvolgimento di Mosca nell’avvelenamento da Novichok del 2018 di Sergei Skripal, un’ex spia russa, a Salisbury, in Inghilterra.\nDurante il processo, la procuratrice Alison Morgan aveva affermato che la cellula di spie era “sofisticata nella sua metodologia; svolgeva attività di sorveglianza di individui e luoghi; creava e utilizzava false identità e impiegava tecnologie avanzate per acquisire informazioni”. Secondo gli investigatori britannici, l’uomo dietro la rete è l’ex direttore di Wirecard e spia russa Jan Marsalek, un cittadino austriaco, che era in contatto con le agenzie di intelligence russe, secondo i pubblici ministeri.\nIl tribunale ha dato seguito all’atto d’accusa del pubblico ministero. Si prevede che la sentenza nei confronti della rete di spie verrà pronunciata nei prossimi giorni. I tre hanno negato di essere coinvolti in azioni di spionaggio e hanno affermato di non sapere per chi lavorassero e di essere stati ingannati dai loro superiori.\n\nIl responsabile dell'organizzazione del partito di Meloni e vicepresidente del Copasir ha aggiunto di non avere intenzione di “mettersi a discutere: ne parleremo in tribunale”.

(Adnkronos) - Con il piano industriale 2024-2028, che prevedono nei cinque anni investimenti per 17,7 miliardi di euro (+7%), Terna conferma gli obiettivi strategici, per adempiere al suo ruolo di Transmission System Operator nazionale. Al centro della strategia per la transizione e l’indipendenza energetica: lo sviluppo infrastrutturale sostenibile, l’integrazione delle rinnovabili e dei sistemi di accumulo, le interconnessioni con l’estero. Il gruppo guidato dall'ad Giuseppina Di Foggia, infatti, dovrà abilitare l’integrazione della nuova capacità di generazione rinnovabile attraverso l’espansione dell’infrastruttura di rete, da pianificare e realizzare insieme allo sviluppo dei sistemi di accumulo e all’incremento dell’adeguatezza del sistema elettrico. Sarà inoltre necessario favorire una maggiore  indipendenza energetica del sistema elettrico nazionale. La capacità rinnovabile che verrà installata nei prossimi anni ha infatti anche l’obiettivo di ridurre la dipendenza italiana dalle commodities importate da paesi stranieri. \nSolo la massima integrazione delle rinnovabili e la più efficiente gestione  dei flussi di energia, sottolinea Terna, potranno infatti garantire all’Italia un futuro energetico più sicuro e indipendente,  con una diminuzione della volatilità dei prezzi per l’utente finale. Terna dovrà anche garantire il servizio di trasmissione dell’energia al Paese, con standard di  assoluta qualità in uno scenario sempre più mutevole, nonché assicurare il più elevato livello di  sicurezza della rete di trasmissione, sia in termini di protezione degli asset fisici sia di cybersecurity, introducendo innovative soluzioni digitali e tecnologiche per far fronte a nuove sfide. Un obiettivo  fondamentale sarà, infine, quello legato all’incremento della resilienza delle infrastrutture, di fronte  all’intensificarsi della frequenza di eventi meteorologici estremi.\nPur mantenendo inalterate le linee strategiche di fondo, l’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024- 2028 rafforza il concetto di Duplice Transizione - Energetica e Digitale, necessaria a garantire una  Just Transition equa e inclusiva per tutti gli stakeholders. Nell’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028, la sostenibilità degli investimenti, sottolinea ancora il gruppo, si conferma  elemento essenziale per la creazione di valore per l’azienda e per il sistema nel suo complesso.  Oltre il 99% degli interventi di Terna, infatti, è considerato sostenibile secondo i criteri di ammissibilità  introdotti dalla Tassonomia Europea.\nLe attività di sviluppo del Gruppo Terna continueranno a essere focalizzate lungo due direttrici  strategiche: Attività Regolate in Italia e Attività Non Regolate. Le attività regolate in Italia continueranno a rappresentare il core business del Gruppo. Terna prevede di investire 16,6 miliardi di euro complessivi nel quinquennio 2024-2028 per sviluppare e  ammodernare la rete di trasmissione elettrica nazionale. Si tratta del Piano di investimenti regolati  più alto di sempre per Terna con un incremento del 7% rispetto al precedente Piano.\nTerna ha registrato un deciso avanzamento nell’execution dei principali progetti che hanno mostrat  importanti progressi negli ultimi 12 mesi in termini di autorizzazioni e catena di fornitura: circa il 90%  dei progetti di investimento è stato autorizzato dalle Autorità competenti (rispetto al 79% di marzo  2024) e circa l’80% di essi è coperto da contratti di approvvigionamento (rispetto al 70% di marzo  2024).\nNell’aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028, Terna prevede di investire complessivamente 10,8 miliardi di euro in cinque anni per lo sviluppo della rete elettrica di trasmissione nazionale. Il 14 marzo 2025, Terna ha presentato il Piano di Sviluppo 2025-2034 che prevede oltre 23 miliardi di euro di investimenti in un orizzonte temporale di dieci anni (+10% rispetto al precedente Piano  decennale 2023-2032). Terna investirà 3,6 miliardi di euro per le attività di rinnovo ed efficienza degli asset, rispetto ai circa  2,9 miliardi di euro previsti nel precedente Piano. Gli investimenti di Terna per il Piano di Sicurezza salgono a 2,3 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai circa 1,7  miliardi di euro previsti nel precedente Piano. Grazie a tutti gli investimenti previsti, il valore degli asset regolati (Regulatory Asset Base, Rab) crescerà dai 22,5 miliardi di euro nel 2024 a circa 32 miliardi di euro nel 2028, con un tasso di crescita  annuo composto (Compound Annual Growth Rate, Cagr) del 9% circa nell’arco di Piano, in  miglioramento rispetto all’8% del precedente Piano. A fine 2025, la Rab sarà pari a 24,8 miliardi di  euro.\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - Terna ha chiuso il 2024 con ricavi pari a 3,680 miliardi di euro, registrano un aumento di 493,5 milioni di euro (+15,5%) rispetto al 2023. L'ebitda del 2024 si attesta a 2,566 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 397,8  milioni di euro rispetto al 2023 (+18,3%), per il miglior risultato delle Attività Regolate. L’Ebit, a valle di ammortamenti e svalutazioni pari a 889,0 milioni  di euro, si attesta a 1.677,4 milioni di euro, rispetto ai 1.362,3 milioni di euro del 2023 (+23,1%). L’utile netto di gruppo dell’esercizio è pari a 1,061 miliardi di euro, in crescita di 176,5 milioni di  euro (+19,9%) rispetto agli 885,4 milioni di euro del 2023. Lo rende noto il gruppo dopo che il Cda, riunitosi oggi sotto la presidenza di Igor De Biasio, ha esaminato e approvato l’Aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028 e i risultati al 31 dicembre 2024 del Gruppo, presentati dall’Amministratore Delegato e Direttore Generale Giuseppina Di Foggia.\nLa situazione patrimoniale consolidata registra un patrimonio netto di Gruppo pari a 7.524,2 milioni di euro, a fronte dei 6.324,4 milioni di euro al 31 dicembre 2023. Gli investimenti complessivi effettuati dal Gruppo Terna nell’esercizio sono stati pari a 2.692,1 milioni  di euro, in forte crescita (+17,6%) rispetto ai 2.290,0 milioni di euro del 2023. Tra i principali progetti  dell’esercizio si segnalano gli avanzamenti del Tyrrhenian Link, il collegamento elettrico sottomarino fra Campania, Sicilia e Sardegna nel cui Ramo Est, quello fra Campania e Sicilia, è stata avviata nei  primi mesi del 2025 la prima fase della posa del cavo sottomarino. A ciò si aggiungono gli  avanzamenti dell’Adriatic Link, l’elettrodotto sottomarino fra Abruzzo e Marche e del collegamento  tra la Toscana, la Corsica e la Sardegna (Sa.Co.I.3), nonché gli interventi per incrementare la  sicurezza e l’efficienza della rete elettrica in alta e altissima tensione nelle aree interessate dai Giochi Olimpici e Paralimpici ‘Milano-Cortina 2026’, quelli per accrescere la capacità di scambio fra la  Calabria e la Sicilia (collegamento Bolano-Annunziata), fra le diverse zone del mercato elettrico in  Sicilia (collegamento Paternò-Pantano-Priolo) e le attività realizzative dei collegamenti ColungaCalenzano, fra Emilia-Romagna e Toscana, e Cassano-Chiari, in Lombardia.\nPer finanziare la significativa crescita degli investimenti a sostegno dello sviluppo di un sistema  elettrico ancora più efficiente, resiliente e digitale, che garantisca la sicurezza energetica del Paese,  l'indebitamento finanziario netto al 31 dicembre 2024 si è attestato a 11.160,4 mln di euro, rispetto ai 10.494,3 mln di euro a fine 2023. L’incremento dell’indebitamento finanziario netto è mitigato dall’emissione obbligazionaria ibrida lanciata il 4 aprile 2024 per un importo di 850 milioni di euro, contabilizzata come strumento di equity.   Nel corso del 2024, grazie all’ampliamento della base asset regolata (Rab) e all’aggiornamento del  Wacc (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) riconosciuto per l’anno, i ricavi delle Attività Regolate sono cresciuti a 3.096,2 mln di euro (2.669,8 mln nel 2023, +16%). Nel 2024, i ricavi delle Attività Non Regolate sono significativamente cresciuti a 584 mln, registrando un +13% rispetto ai 516,8 mln di euro del 2023.\nPer il 2025 è previsto che il gruppo Terna possa conseguire ricavi per 4,03 miliardi di euro, un Ebitda pari a 2,70 miliardi di euro e un utile netto di gruppo pari a 1,08 miliardi di euro. Con specifico riferimento al Piano Investimenti il Gruppo ha un target 2025 pari a circa 3,4 miliardi di euro. Tali obiettivi saranno perseguiti mantenendo l’impegno alla massimizzazione della generazione di cassa necessaria ad assicurare una sana ed equilibrata struttura finanziaria. \nLa nuova politica dei dividendi introduce un livello minimo (floor) pari al dividendo 2024 (39,62 centesimi di euro per azione) per l’intero arco di Piano Industriale 2024-28 Update, con l’obiettivo di garantire agli azionisti una remunerazione interessante e solida. Lo rende noto Terna in un comunicato precisando che la nuova politica prevede, nell’arco di Piano, la distribuzione di un dividendo pari al maggiore tra il valore del dividendo per azione (Dividend Per Share, Dps) 2024 (39,62 centesimi di euro per azione) e una crescita annua del dividendo per azione pari al 4%, assumendo il 2023 come anno di riferimento (33,96 centesimi di euro per azione).\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - I ricavi di gruppo nel 2028 sono previsti in crescita a 5,19 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai 4,60 miliardi di euro del precedente piano, e l’Ebitda a 3,36 miliardi di euro, rispetto ai 3,25 miliardi di euro del  precedente Piano. La crescita media annua (Cagr) nell’arco di Piano sarà di circa il 9% per l’Ebitda. Nel 2025, in particolare, è previsto che i ricavi si attestino a 4,03 miliardi di euro e l’Ebitda a 2,70 miliardi di euro. La crescita dei risultati operativi si rifletterà anche sull’utile netto di Gruppo che passerà da 1,08 miliardi di euro nel 2025 a 1,19 miliardi di euro nel 2028 (rispetto a 1,10 miliardi di euro previsto al  2028 dal precedente Piano). Lo rende noto Terna in un comunicato dopo che il Cda, che si è riunito oggi sotto la presidenza di Igor De Biasio, ha esaminato e approvato l’Aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028 e i risultati al 31 dicembre 2024 del Gruppo, presentati dall’Amministratore Delegato e Direttore Generale Giuseppina Di Foggia.\nIl Consiglio di Amministrazione di Terna proporrà all’Assemblea degli azionisti l’approvazione di un dividendo complessivo per l’esercizio 2024 di 796.358.830,40 euro pari a 39,62 centesimi di euro per azione e la distribuzione al netto dell’acconto sul dividendo ordinario relativo all'esercizio 2024 pari a 11,92 centesimi di euro per azione già posto in pagamento dal 20 novembre 2024 - dei rimanenti 27,70 centesimi di euro per azione, al lordo delle eventuali ritenute di legge, da mettere in pagamento dal 25 giugno 2025 con 'data stacco' 23 giugno 2025 della cedola n. 42. A tale saldo non concorrono le azioni proprie che risulteranno in portafoglio alla 'record date' precedentemente indicata. L’ammontare del saldo del dividendo dell’esercizio 2024 spettante alle azioni proprie detenute dalla società alla 'record date' sarà destinato alla riserva denominata 'utili portati a nuovo'. \nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - \"Che Fratelli d’Italia sia allergico alla libertà di stampa è cosa nota. Ma che il deputato Donzelli arrivi a insultare un giornalista del Fatto Giacomo Salvini con frasi ingiuriose è il limite che non avrebbe dovuto superare. L’Italia non è la Russia di Putin, dove la stampa è asservita al governo e dove i giornalisti vengono insultati, minacciati e a volte anche uccisi. Donzelli e Meloni se ne facciano una ragione”. Lo afferma il segretario di Più Europa Riccardo Magi.\nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - \"Dopo secoli in cui i figli hanno preso il cognome del padre, stabiliamo che prenderanno il solo il cognome della madre\". Dario Franceschini lancia la proposta via social dopo averla preannunciata stamattina all'Assemblea del gruppo Pd del Senato. \"Presenterò un ddl\", ha detto l'ex-ministro. Una \"iniziativa personale\" sulla quale \"non impegno il gruppo\", ha specificato spiegando di vedere la cosa come una sorta di \"risarcimento per una ingiustizia secolare\". Quella appunto del cognome 'ereditato' soltanto dal padre. \nAttualmente in Senato sono in discussione alcune proposte in commissione Giustizia proprio sul tema del cognome. \"Anziché creare infiniti problemi con la gestione dei doppi cognomi -la proposta Franceschini- stabiliamo che dalla nuova legge prenderanno il solo il cognome della madre. E’ una cosa semplice ed anche un risarcimento per una ingiustizia secolare che ha avuto non solo un valore simbolico ma è stata una delle fonti culturali delle disuguaglianze di genere\". Una 'cosa semplice', argomenta l'ex-ministro tuttavia capace di creare polemiche. Critico il centrodestra, perplessità nei 5 Stelle e anche nello stesso Pd tra cattolici e chi, off the records, avrebbe preferito tenere i riflettori accesi oggi tra il pasticcio Irpef del governo e la questione salari italiani 'certificati' dell'Oil come i più bassi tra tutti i Paesi del G20. Tema su cui è intervenuta con nettezza la segretaria Elly Schlein: \"Ultimi senza appello e il governo Meloni non ha mosso un dito\" nè sul versante contratti nè sulla proposta del salario minimo. \nE' la maggioranza a evidenziare il 'gap' tra l'attualità e il tema sollevato da Franceschini. Scrive Matteo Salvini sui social: \"Ecco le grandi priorità della sinistra italiana: invece del doppio cognome, togliere ai bimbi il cognome del padre! Ma certo, cancelliamoli dalla faccia della terra questi papà, così risolviamo tutti i problemi… Ma dove le pensano ste idee geniali?\". E Carlo Calenda si domanda: \"Altre priorità non ne abbiamo? Boh\". \nDiversi esponenti Pd fanno invece sponda con l'ex-ministrom da Laura Boldrini a Valeria Valente e Anna Rossomando che è relatrice per i dem della legge sul doppio cognome: \"Oggi finalmente una voce maschile ha riscontrato che per secoli c'è stata una sorta di invisibilità delle donne, con l'attribuzione del solo cognome del padre\", dice Rossomando. Condivide anche Luana Zanella di Avs anche se ammette che il ddl avrebbe vita difficile: \"E' una proposta interessante e condivisibile, sicuramente guarda molto in là. Vista la difficoltà che abbiamo avuto a far passare il doppio cognome, quello materno e paterno, possiamo immaginare il percorso faticoso di questa proposta. n ogni caso valuterò se presentarla anche alla Camera\". \nMentre Stefano Lepri, cattolico e membro della Direzione Pd, non condivide la proposta di Franceschini: \"Il cognome del padre attribuito ai figli non è un retaggio superato del patriarcato, bensì il primo modo per evitare che l'uomo si limiti alla sua funzione riproduttiva, lasciando interamente alla donna il compito di mantenere e crescere la prole. Le varie proposte sul cognome dei figli non possono dimenticare l'importanza cruciale di responsabilizzare i maschi - pubblicamente e fin dalla nascita - nel loro dovere di essere davvero padri\". \nE per il costituzionalista Cesare Mirabelli, il ddl avrebbe vita difficile anche dal punto di costituzionale. \"Si presta alle stesse censure di illegittimità che riguardavano l'obbligo di trasmettere ai figli solo il cognome paterno. Una diseguaglianza -dice all'Adnkronos- non si sana capovolgendola e introducendone un'altra. Il ddl Franceschini sarà criticabile ed impugnabile per illegittimità costituzionale se mai dovesse arrivare al traguardo. Ma io credo che probabilmente già nell'iter legislativo dopo che la Commissione Affari costituzionali ne valuterà la costituzionalità in chiave politica, il ddl sarà bloccato. Non arriverà in Aula\". \nRoma, 25 mar. (Adnkronos) - Nei cinque anni di Piano gli investimenti di Terna salgono a complessivi 17,7 miliardi  di euro (+7%, pari a 1,2 miliardi di euro in più nello stesso arco temporale).

(Adnkronos) - \"Vorrei riassumere in tre punti i capisaldi dell'aggiornamento del Piano Industriale 2024-2028  presentato oggi: significativo incremento degli investimenti che, con 17,7 miliardi di euro in cinque anni, segnano un nuovo record per Terna; programmazione territoriale, per facilitare l’integrazione  delle fonti rinnovabili nella rete, che renderemo ancora più affidabile ed efficiente; rafforzamento del  ruolo del Gruppo al servizio della sicurezza elettrica e dell’indipendenza energetica del Paese\". Ad affermarlo è Giuseppina Di Foggia, l'amministratore delegato e direttore generale di Terna dopo che il Cda ha esaminato e approvato l'aggiornamento del piano industriale 2024-28.\n\"Puntiamo - aggiunge - su sostenibilità e digitalizzazione per realizzare infrastrutture fondamentali per la  decarbonizzazione del Paese, a ridotto impatto ambientale, e per gestire una rete più resiliente e  pronta ad affrontare le sfide del settore energetico\".\n\"Con i risultati ottenuti nel 2024, frutto del lavoro e della competenza delle nostre persone, continuiamo a creare valore per i nostri stakeholder e ci confermiamo come un gruppo sempre più solido nel panorama energetico nazionale, consapevoli della responsabilità che ci è stata affidata: abilitare la transizione energetica, garantendo i più alti livelli di qualità del servizio di trasmissione, al minor costo possibile per imprese e cittadini\". \n\"Grazie agli sforzi che stiamo facendo per sostenere la transizione energetica con maggiori investimenti nelle attività regolate e massimizzando i business nelle attività non regolate siamo in grado di migliorare i target di crescita dell'utile netto ad un media del 6% l'anno nel periodo di piano assicurando una stabilità finanziaria. Confidiamo di essere sulla strada giusta\".\n\"La nostra priorità strategica - sottolinea Di Foggia - è quella di guidare la transizione energetica verso le rinnovabili in Italia migliorando la qualità, la sicurezza e la resilienza della rete e riducendo al contempo molto la dipendenza del nostro sistema elettrico dalle commodities importate. Lo sviluppo delle rinnovabili e dello storage sostenuti dai contratti a lungo termine consentiranno una maggiore stabilità delle bollette elettriche per il consumatore finale\".\nGentile lettore, la pubblicazione dei commenti è sospesa dalle 20 alle 9, i commenti per ogni articolo saranno chiusi dopo 72 ore, il massimo di caratteri consentito per ogni messaggio è di 1.500 e ogni utente può postare al massimo 150 commenti alla settimana.

            "full_content": "Six Bulgarians carried out sophisticated operations over three years, including spying on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany.\nThree Bulgarian nationals based in the United Kingdom have been convicted by a London jury of spying for Russia on what police said was “an industrial scale”.\nThe trio was accused of putting lives in danger as they followed orders on behalf of Russian intelligence to carry out surveillance across Europe on Kremlin opponents, including journalists, diplomats and Ukrainian troops.\nA jury at London’s Old Bailey court on Friday found Bulgarian nationals Katrin Ivanova, 43, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, guilty of spying for Russia on what police said was “an industrial scale.”\nThe trio engaged in a series of surveillance and intelligence operations over three years during which one of their ringleaders nicknamed them “the Minions”, a reference to the yellow sidekicks in movie, Despicable Me, who work for supervillain Gru.\nThe defendants – who worked for the Russian intelligence service GRU – face up to 14 years in prison when they are sentenced in May along with three other Bulgarian members of the same spy cell.\nThe trio’s leader, Orlin Roussev, 47, his deputy Biser Dzhambazov, 43, and co-conspirator Ivan Stoyanov had all pleaded guilty to spying for Russia shortly before the trial.\nRoussev received more than 200,000 euros ($217,000) to fund the spying activities.\nThe mastermind of the operation was alleged Russian agent Jan Marsalek, 44, an Austrian businessman wanted by Interpol after the collapse of German payment processing firm Wirecard.\nMarsalek, whose current whereabouts are unknown but is believed to be in Russia, acted as a go-between linking Russian intelligence and the spy ring, instructing them to carry out six serious operations in the UK, Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro until their arrest in 2023.\n“This was spying on an almost industrial scale on behalf of Russia, the Russian state and Russian intelligence services,” said Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of London police’s Counter Terrorism Command.\nBritish prosecutors said Marsalek tasked the British-based Bulgarian team with spying on Ukrainian soldiers being trained at a US base in Germany, with a view to tracking their movements on the battlefield after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\nAnother operation involved spying on Christo Grozev, a journalist with investigative website Bellingcat, who led a report on the 2018 poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England, with a view to kidnapping or even killing him.\nThe group also targeted British-based Russian Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of The Insider, Bergey Ryskaliyev, a former Kazakh politician granted asylum in the UK, and Russian dissident Kiril Kachur.\nThey discussed dropping fake pigs’ blood on the Kazakhstan Embassy in London by drone as part of a fake protest intended to win favour with Kazakh spies.\nPolice found a trove of what they called “really sophisticated” spyware in a raid on Roussev’s operations centre in a former guesthouse in the seaside town of Great Yarmouth, described in text messages as his “Indiana Jones garage”.\nIt included homemade audiovisual spy devices hidden inside everyday objects including a rock, men’s ties, a Coke bottle and a Minions cuddly toy.\n“Really sophisticated devices – the sort of thing you would really expect to see in a spy novel – were found here, in Great Yarmouth and London,” said  Murphy.\nDzhambazov, who worked for a medical courier company but claimed to be an Interpol police officer, was in a relationship with two other defendants — his laboratory assistant partner Ivanova and beautician Gaberova.\nGaberova, in turn, had ditched painter-decorator Ivanchev for Dzhambazov, who took her to Michelin-starred restaurants and stayed with her in a five-star hotel.\nWhen police moved in to arrest the suspects in February 2023, they found Dzhambazov in bed with Gaberova rather than at home with Ivanova.\nBoth women claimed during the trial that they had been deceived and manipulated by Dzhambazov.\nMr Justice Hilliard KC remanded the defendants into custody until sentencing between May 7 and May 12.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

Ihre Gehälter bleiben weiterhin aus. \nDas Auf und Ab beim Flugtaxi-Startup Lilium ist vor allem für die Mitarbeitenden zermürbend. Weil der Großinvestor DTM die versprochenen 150 Millionen Euro nicht an Lilium überwies, konnte das Startup seinen Mitarbeitenden die Gehälter für Januar und Februar nicht zahlen. Daraufhin entschied das Team um Geschäftsführer Severin Tatarczyk, Insolvenz anzumelden. Die Mitarbeitenden wurden frei- und der Geschäftsbetrieb eingestellt.\nNun steht auch fest: Ein zweites Mal Insolvenzgeld werden die Mitarbeitenden nicht bekommen – und damit auch keine Gehälter. Die Bundesagentur für Arbeit habe dies abgelehnt. Das teilte ihnen Rechtsanwalt Robert Hänel in einem All-Wings-Meeting am Mittwochmorgen mit, wie Gründerszene aus dem Unternehmensumfeld erfahren und Hänel gegenüber Gründerszene bestätigt hat.\nLaut Hänel handle es sich dabei um eine Entscheidung für den jetzigen Moment. „Das ist natürlich dramatisch für die Beschäftigten und für einige existenzgefährdend. Den Auflösungsprozess dürfte das noch einmal beschleunigen“, heißt es von Hänel. Gespräche, ob die Lilium-Mitarbeitenden nicht doch noch Anspruch auf Insolvenzgeld haben, sollen laut dem Rechtsanawalt noch geführt werden. „Gleichwohl laufen weiter die Bemühungen, doch noch die ursprünglich zugesagten Investorengelder zu erhalten“, heißt es von Seiten Hänels.\nUm möglichst schnell Geld zu bekommen, hätten Mitarbeitende aus EU-Ländern bei einer Freistellung einen Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld. Komplizierter werde es jedoch bei den Lilium-Mitarbeitenden, die nicht aus EU-Ländern stammen, sagt Hänel gegenüber Gründerszene. Hier bestehe kein Anspruch auf Arbeitslosengeld. Er suche gemeinsam mit der Bundesagentur für Arbeit und den zuständigen Ausländerbehörden nach einer Lösung.\nOffen ist noch die Frage nach dem Geld. Warum kommt das Geld vom Großinvestor DTM nicht? Wo ist es? Hänel sagt gegenüber Gründerszene, er habe die Information, dass es ein Konto gebe, auf dem das Geld vorhanden sei. Dies sei seinen Informationen nach auch bestätigt. „Alle, mit denen ich gesprochen habe, auch die Kanzlei, die die anderen Insolvenzverfahren betreut, sind davon ausgegangen, dass das klappen wird“, sagt Hänel gegenüber Gründerszene.\nWie es jetzt weiter geht? Hänel werde „alle Voraussetzungen schaffen, damit Mitarbeitende Arbeitslosengeld bekommen“. Außerdem werde er in Gespräche mit dem zuständigen Insolvenzgericht gehen und Kündigungsschreiben aufsetzen, damit diese vorbereitet sind, für den Fall, dass die Belegschaft im Rahmen des vorläufigen Insolvenzverfahrens entlassen werden muss.\nMitarbeitende zeigen sich in Gesprächen mit Gründerszene in den vergangenen Wochen verärgert und fassungslos über die fehlenden Gehälter und den Umgang mit ihnen. Sie haben den Glauben und das Vertrauen in die Firma verloren. Eine nennt Lilium „das nächste Wirecard“.\nIm Oktober 2024 meldete Lilium Insolvenz in Eigenverwaltung an. Zuvor hatte die Ampel-Regierung staatliche Wandeldarlehen in Höhe von 100 Millionen Euro abgelehnt. Zwei Monate später hat das Startup seine rund 1.000 Mitarbeitenden entlassen. Für knapp 800 von ihnen kam jedoch in allerletzter Sekunde ein Hoffnungsschimmer an Heiligabend: Es fand sich ein Investorenkonsortium, das Lilium retten, dem Startup über 200 Millionen Euro geben wolle. Ein Großteil der Belegschaft kehrte im Januar dieses Jahres wieder an seine Arbeitsplätze zurück. \nInitiiert wurde das Investorenkonsortium vom Münchner VC Earlybird und vom Unternehmer Philipp Schoeller. Zu den weiteren Investoren gehören unter anderem der I​​mmobilieninvestor Fifth Wall aus den USA und der Batteriezulieferer von Lilium Customcells. Lead-Investor ist aber DTM. Die ersten fünf Millionen an Lilium haben aber andere überwiesen, wie Gründerszene im Januar exklusiv aus dem Unternehmensumfeld erfahren hat: nämlich die Szeneköpfe Frank Thelen, Christian Reber (Wunderlist und Pitch), Jan Beckers (Ioniq-Gründer und Investor) und Niklas Zennström (Atomico). Bei dem Investment soll es sich um Wandeldarlehen handeln. \nDie beiden anderen Insolvenzverfahren, die der Lilium GmbH und die der Lilium eAircraft GmbH, laufen weiterhin. Vermögenswerte wie Patente liegen weiterhin bei der Lilium GmbH und Lilium eAircraft GmbH. „Das nach wie vor diesen Gesellschaften zustehende Vermögen wird zu Gunsten der Gläubiger dieser Gesellschaften nunmehr im Rahmen der Liquidation verwertet werden“, teilt die Kanzlei Görg mit, die mit der Abwicklung der Insolvenzverfahren beauftragt ist. \nNeben Lilium befindet sich seit Kurzem auch Volocopter in einem Insolvenzverfahren. Die Mitarbeitenden seien mit sofortiger Wirkung freigestellt. Volocopter hatte Ende Dezember 2024 Insolvenz angemeldet. Die Mitarbeitenden erfuhren kurz nach Weihnachten davon. Der Niedergang kam nicht plötzlich. Vergangenes Jahr hatte Volocopter Kreditbürgschaften in Höhe von 100 Millionen Euro beantragt, doch der Staat sprang wie bei Lilium ab. Und auch Übernahmeverhandlungen mit dem chinesischen Konzern Geely scheiterten.\nSie haben erfolgreich Ihre Einwilligung in die Nutzung von Business Insider mit Tracking und Cookies widerrufen. \n\n\nStartseite |  Newsletter | Newsticker | Mediadaten\nAbo-Angebote | App | FAQ |  Abo kündigen\nImpressum & Kontakt |  Datenschutz | AGB | Jobs & Karriere\nPrivatsphäre |  Disclaimer | Widerrufsbelehrung\nCopyright © 2025 Business Insider Deutschland GmbH.\nAlle Rechte vorbehalten."

            "full_content": "Zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien sollen im Auftrag von Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Jan Marsalek spioniert haben. Eine der Angeklagten sollte einen Russland-kritischen Journalisten verführen. \nIn einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland sind in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden. Sie handelten mutmaßlich im Auftrag von Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Jan Marsalek, wie die Nachrichtenagentur PA meldete. Ihnen drohen Haftstrafen von bis zu 14 Jahren. Das Strafmaß soll noch verkündet werden. Marsalek habe demnach als Vermittler zwischen dem russischen Geheimdienst und dem Anführer des Spionagerings gehandelt.\n   Der Ex-Wirecard-Vertriebsvorstand ist seit der Pleite des ehemaligen Dax-Konzerns untergetaucht und wird in Russland vermutet. In dem Londoner Prozess war Marsalek nicht selbst angeklagt.\n   „Das war Spionage im industriellen Stil für Russland“, sagte der Anti-Terror-Chef der Londoner Polizei, Dominic Murphy. Es seien Beweismittel in dem Maße gefunden worden, wie man sie eigentlich in einem Spionageroman erwarten würde. Vor Gericht waren zudem romantische Dreiecksbeziehungen innerhalb der Spionagegruppe Thema.\n   Eine der Angeklagten sollte als sogenannte Honigfalle für einen bekannten Russland-kritischen Journalisten eingesetzt werden, im Versteck des Spionagerings wurden Video- und Tonaufnahmegeräte in Alltagsgegenständen gefunden. Der Chef des Ringes sowie sein Stellvertreter hatten im vergangenen November die Spionage für Russland eingeräumt. Beide stammen ebenfalls aus Bulgarien, auch für sie steht das Strafmaß noch nicht fest. Zudem soll es Entführungspläne gegeben haben.\n   Marsalek soll als Vermittler zwischen dem russischen Geheimdienst und dem Anführer der Gruppe in Großbritannien gehandelt haben. Der Ex-Wirecard-Vertriebsvorstand ist seit der Pleite des ehemaligen Dax-Konzerns untergetaucht und wird in Russland vermutet. In dem Londoner Prozess war Marsalek nicht selbst angeklagt. Zitiert wurden etliche Textnachrichten, die von dem Österreicher stammen sollen.\n   Marsalek war der für das operative Geschäft und die Asien-Aktivitäten zuständige Vorstand des kollabierten Zahlungsdienstleisters Wirecard. Er wurde später in Zusammenhang mit russischen Geheimdiensten gebracht. Der Münchner Dax-Konzern brach im Juni 2020 zusammen, als aufflog, dass dem Zahlungsabwickler auf Treuhandkonten in Asien 1,9 Milliarden Euro fehlten. Es handelt sich um einen der größten Finanzskandale der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte. Andere Wirecard-Manager stehen deswegen in München vor Gericht.\n   Es sei eine extrem ausgeklügelte Geheimdienstoperation gewesen, die eine Bedrohung für die nationale Sicherheit und für Einzelpersonen dargestellt habe, sagte Murphy. Wäre die Gruppe nicht verhaftet worden, hätten letztlich Menschenleben auf dem Spiel stehen können, wie es beim Nowitschok-Anschlag 2018 in Salisbury der Fall gewesen sei. Damals war der übergelaufene russische Agent Sergej Skripal mit dem Nervenkampfstoff Nowitschok vergiftet worden.\n   In dem Londoner Prozess waren insgesamt fünf Bulgaren angeklagt. Anders als die nun schuldig Gesprochenen hatten zwei von ihnen Geständnisse abgelegt. Laut Staatsanwaltschaft soll Marsalek die Gruppe beauftragt haben, auf einer US-Militärbasis in Deutschland in Ausbildung befindliche ukrainische Soldaten ausspioniert zu haben. Zudem soll die Gruppe Journalisten ausgeforscht und einen fingierten Protest vor der kasachischen Botschaft in London geplant haben. Die russische Botschaft in London äußerte sich nicht zu dem Urteil.\n   Die Angeklagten im Alter von 33, 30 und 39 sollen Personen und Orte ausgespäht haben oder geplant haben das zu tun, die für Russland interessant sind. In Deutschland seien das etwa eine Luftwaffenbasis sowie eine nicht näher genannte Botschaft gewesen. Die Spione waren im Februar 2023 verhaftet worden.\n   Die Spionageaktivitäten sollen in London sowie in Wien, Stuttgart, Valencia und dem Balkanstaat Montenegro stattgefunden haben. Dafür hätten die Angeklagten beträchtliche Geldsummen erhalten, hatte die Staatsanwältin im Verlauf des Prozesses gesagt. Sky News zufolge wurden bei der Razzia im Versteck unter anderem 495 SIM-Karten, 221 Telefone, 258 Festplatten und 11 Drohnen gefunden worden. (APA)"

            "full_content": "Less than $3 per week\n'Amateurish' spy ring in Norfolk seaside town exposes the decline of Russian intelligence\nWhen counter-terrorism police raided a \"modest\" former guest house in Great Yarmouth, in 2023, they found a trove of spy gadgets, said Mark Hollingsworth in The Independent: bugs, signal jammers, cameras hidden in glasses and ties and stuffed toys. From this \"unlikely\" setting in Norfolk, Orlin Roussev, a Bulgarian national, had been running a Russian-backed spy ring: he and his accomplices had hatched plans to \"burgle, honey-trap, murder and kidnap\" across Europe.\nTheir paymaster was Jan Marsalek, a fugitive Austrian businessman wanted for his role in the €1.9 billion Wirecard fraud, who now lives in Moscow and who told them that he was working for Russian intelligence; their targets included Russian dissidents and the journalist Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian who had exposed Kremlin links to the Salisbury poisonings. Last week, three members of the ring were convicted in London of spying for Russia. Roussev and two others had already pleaded guilty.\nRussian espionage has always been a dirty business, said Owen Matthews in The Spectator. But in the past it was at least effective and ingenious. Today, it seems to be \"pathetic\" and \"amateurish\". Roussev assembled a \"motley group\" of Bulgarians – a medical courier, a beautician, a decorator – whom he nicknamed his \"minions\" after the sidekicks of the villain Gru in the children's film \"Despicable Me\". They used silly code names: Mad Max, Jackie Chan. Three of them were involved in a tawdry love triangle. When Roussev was arrested, thousands of incriminating messages were found on his phone, which he hadn't even thought to erase. The reason for the decline is that, since Salisbury and the Ukraine War, scores of Russian diplomats and spies have been expelled from the UK – so Moscow has resorted to \"recruiting criminals\".\nEscape your echo chamber.

They tracked Grozev across Europe. Their handler, Marsalek, proposed killing the Russian journalist Roman Dobrokhotov: \"Maybe burn him alive in the street, spray him with some super-strong acid,\" he suggested.

Acum, investigaÈiile serviciilor occidentale aratÄ cÄ acesta avea ca obiectiv formarea unei armate de 15.000 de mercenari pentru a âarmoniza fluxul de migranÈiâ, o strategie care ar fi servit interesele Kremlinului, potrivit The TelegraphÂ Èi Reuters.\nAncheta dezvÄluie legÄturi Ã®ntre Jan Marsalek Èi oficiali austrieci. Ãn 2017, guvernul austriac ar fi promis investiÈii de peste 120.000 de euro pentru un proiect de âstabilizare a migraÈiei Ã®n Libiaâ, iniÈiat de Marsalek.

            "full_content": "ЛОНДОН, 7 марта. /ТАСС/. Центральный уголовный суд Лондона Олд-Бейли признал трех граждан Болгарии виновными в шпионаже в пользу России. Об этом говорится в заявлении Скотленд-Ярда.\nРечь идет о 33-летней лаборантке Катрин Ивановой, 30-летнем косметологе Ване Габеровой и 39-летнем декораторе Тихомире Иванчеве. Все они проживали в Лондоне. Прокуратура обвиняла их в сборе информации, \"которая была бы прямо или косвенно полезна недружественной стороне\", в период с 30 августа 2020 года по 8 февраля 2023 года. Иванова также была признана виновной в подделке официальных документов, в том числе паспортов и других удостоверений личности.\nСогласно обвинителям, виновные действовали по указанию австрийского бизнесмена Яна Марсалека, который ранее работал главным операционным директором компании Wirecard и в настоящее время разыскивается властями Германии по подозрению в мошенничестве. В Соединенном Королевстве против Марсалека не было выдвинуто каких-либо обвинений. Британские СМИ писали, что предприниматель может находиться в России, но не приводили доказательств.\nОбвиняемыми по делу о шпионаже также проходят другие граждане Болгарии - Орлин Русев, Бизер Джамбазов и Иван Стоянов. Прокуратура называла Русева лидером этой группы болгарских граждан. Русев, Джамбазов и Стоянов признали в суде свою вину. Приговор всем фигурантам этого дела, как ожидается, будет вынесен в мае.\nПо данным стороны обвинения, эта группа болгарских граждан следила за журналистом издания Bellingcat (внесено Минюстом РФ в реестр иноагентов) Христо Грозевым (также признан иноагентом), журналистом Романом Доброхотовым, бывшим акимом Атырауской области Казахстана Бергеем Рыскалиевым, а также за блогером Кириллом Качуром (признан иноагентом) в Черногории. Кроме того, они якобы вели наблюдение за обучением украинских военнослужащих на американской военной базе в Штутгарте.\nКак заявило посольство РФ, комментируя в декабре этот процесс, Лондон с новой силой нагнетает антироссийскую пропаганду и дезинформацию, чтобы отвести внимание от внутренних проблем и сложного положения Украины в конфликте с Россией."

            "full_content": "В пятницу присяжные в Лондоне признали граждан Болгарии Ваню Габерову, Катрин Иванову и Тихомира Иванчева виновными в шпионаже в пользу России. Еще трое их подельников признали вину ранее. В этом тексте наши коллеги рассказывают, чем эти люди занимались.\nВ статье наших коллег из Отдела расследований Би-би-си упоминаются лица и организации, которым российские власти присвоили следующие статусы: Роман Доброхотов — «иностранный агент», The Insider — «иностранный агент», «нежелательная организация», Bellingcat — «иностранный агент», «нежелательная организация», Христо Грозев — «иностранный агент», Кирилл Качур — «иностранный агент».\nРоман Доброхотов привык постоянно оглядываться.\nЕго расследования действий режима Владимира Путина (например, материал с разоблачением агентов, ответственных за отравление в Солсбери) сделали этого российского журналиста мишенью для Кремля.\nКогда он, главный редактор издания The Insider, в 2021 году ждал посадки на самолет из Будапешта в Берлин, он не обратил внимания на стоявшую за ним брюнетку. В Берлине ему предстояло дать показания по делу об убийстве в столице Германии чеченского полевого командира Зелимхана Хангошвили.\nЖурналист также не придал никакого значения тому, что в самолете брюнетка села на соседнее место. Не заметил он и закрепленной у нее на плече камеры, которая записывала происходящее.\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nВ то утро эта женщина прилетела в Будапешт из Лондона, чтобы следить за журналистом. Информацию о рейсе, которым летел Доброхотов, она получила заранее.\nКогда самолет приземлился, женщина — это была гражданка Болгарии Катрин Иванова — отправила сообщение в телеграме:\nЗатем она отправила еще два сообщения.\nПартнер брюнетки Биcер Джамбаcов, с которым она жила в районе Харроу на севере Лондона, ждал ее и Доброхотова в Берлине.\nЕще одна женщина  —  сотрудница аэропорта, которую следователи называют Цветкой,  —  к тому времени уже прилетела из Лондона в Берлин. В Берлине она была еще одной «парой глаз».\nОни потеряли Доброхотова из виду.\nЯчейка работала уже не один год и вела слежку за «врагами России» по всей Европе. Ее лидеры придумывали, как организовать компрометирующие ситуации, похищения и убийства в интересах Кремля. \nПрисяжные в Лондоне 7 марта признали трех членов ячейки — Ваню Габерову, Катрин Иванову и Тихомира Иванчева — виновными в сговоре с целью совершения преступления. Еще трое ранее сами признали свою вину.\n«Мы находимся в ситуации, когда выживут только некоторые из нас», — скажет позже Доброхотов в интервью Би-би-си.\n«Это будут либо российские журналисты и правозащитники, либо Владимир Путин и его убийцы», — пояснил журналист.\nЕще один участник телеграм-чата — 47-летний болгарин Орлин Русев — наблюдал за происходящим в Берлине из Британии.\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nТут мы публикуем только главные новости и самые интересные тексты. Канал доступен для нероссийских номеров.\nКонец истории Реклама WhatsApp-канала\nОдин из сообщников Русева рассказывает, что тому очень нравилось заниматься шпионажем. Адрес электронной почты, который приписывают Русеву, включает символы «007», напоминая о самом известном в мире секретном агенте.\nРусев переехал в Великобританию в 2009 году. Там он основал компанию, занимающуюся мониторингом и анализом трафика связи, который подразумевал перехват сообщений и других сигналов электронных устройств.\nКогда сотрудники полиции обыскали бывший гостевой дом с 33 комнатами в Грейт-Ярмуте на берегу Северного моря, где Русев жил с женой и пасынком, они обнаружили, по оценке одного из экспертов, «огромное количество технического оборудования для слежки, которое можно было использовать для обеспечения пристального наблюдения».\nЭксперт мог бы выразиться и более образно. Полицейские по сути нашли пещеру Аладдина, замаскированную под захламленный домик у моря.\nСложные устройства для перехвата сообщений стоимостью 175 000 фунтов стерлингов; радиочастотные глушители; скрытые камеры, спрятанные в детекторах дыма, ручке, солнцезащитных очках и даже в мужских галстуках; стопка поддельных удостоверений личности и оборудование для их изготовления. На виду лежал зашифрованный жесткий диск. На ноутбуке Русева были открыты чаты в телеграме.\nСреди огромного количества оборудования полиция нашла визитку бывшего операционного директора финтех-компании Wirecard Яна Марсалека.\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nРусев впервые встретился с Марсалеком в 2015 году. По его воспоминаниям, их представил друг другу общий знакомый, которого Русев встретил в офисе британского инвестора и финансового советника. \nБи-би-си ознакомилась с электронными письмами тех лет: Марсалек там  обратился к Русеву за помощью в покупке у китайской компании защищенного мобильного телефона.\nАвтор фото, PP Muenchen\nТогда Ян Марсалек занимал пост операционного директора немецкой компании Wirecard. Хотя в Financial Times уже начали появляться статьи с критикой деловой практики Wirecard, репутация компании как звезды европейского финтеха еще не пострадала. Тогда — на пике своего успеха — Wirecard оценивалась более чем в 20 миллиардов фунтов стерлингов (25,23 млрд долларов США).\nТеперь Марсалек, скрывась от преследований по делу о мошенничестве после банкротства Wirecard в 2020 году, руководил операциями Русева.\nВместе они — Русев и Марсалек — планировали операции против журналистов, диссидентов, политиков и даже украинских военных, которые, по их данным, проходили обучение на американской военной базе в Штутгарте. Они обсуждали продажу Китаю американских дронов, которые были захвачены на поле боя в Украине. Все это они делали в интересах России.\nБудучи связанным с российской разведкой, Марсалек, предположительно, может скрываться от немецкого суда в Москве. В Великобритании ему не предъявлено обвинений.\nГруппа, которую нанял Русев, не состояла из шпионов в расхожем понимании этого слова. \nВместе с Джамбазовым, который работал медицинским курьером, и Ивановой, ассистенткой в лаборатории, он нанял косметолога Ваню Габерову, у которой был салон красоты в лондонском районе Актон; художника и маляра Тихомира Иванчева; и Ивана Стоянова — бойца смешанных единоборств с превдонимом «Разрушитель». Следы боев Стоянова были видны на его лице.\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout and social media\nСосед двух обвиненных членов ячейки довольно скептически отнесся к их возможной причастности к шпионажу. По его словам, они были слишком глупы и ничего не знали. При этом он восхищался «огромными икрами» «Разрушителя».\nНо нельзя сказать, что они плохо справлялись с возложенными на них задачами. Роман Доброхотов не смог узнать никого из членов группы, когда сотрудники полиции показали ему их фотографии.\nВ группе была четкая иерархия. Русев отчитывался перед Марсалеком, который, в свою очередь, передавал информацию «друзьям в России». Русев руководил работой граждан Болгарии, которых он называл своими «миньонами», а Джамбазова их главой.\n«Здесь нет начальников», — написал Джамбазов, когда давал задание Иванчеву. Тем не менее, на телефоне Джамбазова контакт художника Иванчева был записан как «миньон».\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nЛичные отношения в группе были довольно запутанными. Джамбазов и Иванова были в длительных отношениях и жили вместе. Габерова и Иванчев состояли в отношениях до 2022 года.\nКогда в феврале 2023 года полиция ворвалась в квартиру косметолога на северо-западе Лондона, то обнаружила Джамбазова и Габерову вместе в постели.\nВ период с августа 2020 года по февраль 2023 года Марсалек и Русев обменялись 78 747 сообщениями в телеграме.\nБлагодаря этим сообщениям были раскрыты как минимум шесть операций, которые шпионская ячейка выполняла в течение нескольких лет. Четыре из них были направлены против «врагов путинского режима».\nПомимо слежки за Доброхотовым, ячейка вела наблюдение за местом, где жил в Вене журналист-расследователь Христо Грозев. Камеры, установленные в окне расположенной рядом съемной квартиры, были направлены на входную дверь квартиры журналиста.\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nЗа Грозевым вели слежку во время перелетов, его фотографили в отеле в Валенсии, когда он завтракал с сооснователям расследовательского проекта Bellingcat Эллиотом Хиггинсом.\nГрозев, бельмо на глазу для российских разведслужб, был под наблюдением и когда встречался в Болгарии с торговцем оружием — жертвой покушения на убийство, организацию которого сооснователь Bellingcat связывал с российским государством.\nГаберова получила указания подружиться с ним.\nВ Черногории ячейка занималась поисками Кирилла Качура, бывшего сотрудника Следственного комитета России, который попал в немилость Кремлю.\nОни очень хотели произвести впечатление на своих покровителей.\nПоблизости действовала еще одна шпионская группировка, работавшая на Россию, в которой состояла и беспрестанно курившая блондинка под кодовым именем «Красный воробей».\nАвтор фото, Kirill Kachur/YouTube\nМарсалек и Русев обсуждали похищение и убийство как Грозева, так и Качура. Это были не пустые угрозы — одного из коллег Качура уже вывезли в Москву.\nИх целью был и Бергей Рыскалиев — бывший политик из Казахстана, получивший статус беженца и живущий в элитной квартире рядом с лондонским Гайд-парком. За его домом было установлено наблюдение.\nАвтор фото, Bergey Ryskaliyev/Facebook\nИван Стоянов, признавший свое участие в заговоре, был замечен, когда он сидел в припаркованной Toyota Prius по адресу Рыскалиева. Автомобиль вызвал подозрение у помощника бывшего казахстанского политика, и он записал номерной знак.\nКогда Стоянова спросили, что он там делает, «Разрушитель» заявил, что он работает курьером больницы в районе Кенсингтон (где живет Рыскалиев). На следующий день на его лобовом стекле появился логотип Национальной службы здравоохранения (NHS).\nОбвинение говорит, что предоставление информации о таком политическом диссиденте, как Рыскалиев, «основано на попытках России контролировать дипломатические отношения».\nДействительно, затем Марсалек дал Русеву другое задание: хитроумную схему организации фейкового протеста у посольства Казахстана. Она включала в себя кровь, сброшенную дронами, фальшивую кампанию по защите прав человека с участием движения Just Stop Oil, письмо главе Европейской комиссии Урсуле фон дер Ляйен, рекламу на автобусах в Лондоне и так и не сфабрикованное порнографическое дипфейк-видео с сыном президента Казахстана.\nПо замыслу, Россия затем помогла бы разнервничавшимся службам безопасности Казахстана «разоблачить» ответственных за происходящее «активистов».\nВ феврале 2022 года Марсалек и Русев обсуждали возможность слежки за Христо Грозевым в Киеве, куда он, по их данным, приехал. \nНо их предложение о помощи было отклонено.\nСпустя менее трех недель российские танки вторглись в Украину через восточную, южную и северную границы страны.\nПозднее, в том же 2022 году, Марсалек спросил у Русева, может ли один из его IMSI-перехватчиков (специальное устройство для перехвата коммуникаций) быть использован для слежки за украинскими военными в Германии. Русев пообещал достать девайс из своего «гаража Индианы Джонса», где тот «пылился».\nАвтор фото, Metropolitan Police handout\nМарсалек неоднократно возвращался к этой теме.\nК февралю 2023 года Русев и Марсалек планировали послать Джамбазова и «еще одного человека» в Штуттгарт, где, по их данным, украинские военные учились работать с ЗРК Patriot.\nЕсли бы их миссия удалась и они бы перехватили данные мобильных телефонов украинских военных, они затем могли бы использовать эти данные, чтобы определить местоположение этих военных на поле боя. Это бы привело Россию к противовоздушных комплексам, предоставленным западными странами.\n«Это был в высшей степени серьезный шпионаж», — сказала прокурор Элисон Морган присяжным в суде.\nНо, прежде чем они смогли осуществить свой план, их арестовали: Джамбазова, Иванову, Габерову и Стоянова в Лондоне, Русева — в его гостевом доме в Грейт-Ярмуте.\nХотя Иванчев назвал себя полиции у квартиры Габеровой, его арестовали только через год.\nНа первом допросе в полиции он заявил, что до этого уже поговорил с  представителями МИ-5 (британской контрразведки). Допрос был приостановлен.\nНикто из этих шести не отрицал своих действий.\nРусев, Джамбазов и Стоянов признали вину еще до суда. Иванова, Габерова и Иванчев заявили, что не знали, что работали на Россию. Присяжные согласились с этим.\nИм грозило до 14 лет тюрьмы. Приговор им будет оглашен 7 мая.\n«Если режим не сменится, то будут появляться все новые и новые группы  людей, которые придут, чтобы убить или похитить тебя», — сказал Роман Доброхотов Би-би-си.\n«На самом деле, это мотивирует нас продолжать свою работу. С самого начала я был уверен, что это находится под прямым контролем Владимира Путина. При его диктатуре ты никогда не возьмешь на себя ответственность за такого рода политические действия. Это должен быть прямой указ президента».\n«Путин — психопат, не знающий границ», — сказал Доброхотов.\n© 2025 BBC. Би-би-си не несет ответственности за содержание других сайтов.

Sie sollen für Moskau russlandkritische Journalisten und eine Militärbasis in Stuttgart ausgespäht haben. Beauftragt wurden sie von Jan Marsalek.\nEin Londoner Gericht hat drei bulgarische Agenten für schuldig befunden, für Russland spioniert zu haben. Damit folgten die Geschworenen der Anklage der Staatsanwaltschaft. Hintermann des Netzwerks ist nach Erkenntnissen britischer Ermittler der ehemalige Wirecard-Manager Jan Marsalek.Katrin Ivanova, 33, Vanya Gaberova, 30, und Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, haben zwischen 2020 und 2023 dem Kreml missliebige Personen ausgeforscht und diese quer durch Europa verfolgt. Zu den Beschatteten gehörten unter anderem die Journalisten Christo Grosew und Roman Dobrochotow. Die beiden hatten zur Rolle Russlands bei den Nervengiftanschlägen auf den mittlerweile verstorbenen Oppositionellen Alexej Nawalny und auf Sergej Skripal in Salisbury recherchiert. Auch eine US-amerikanische Militärbasis in Stuttgart, in der ukrainische Soldaten trainiert wurden, spionierten die Angeklagten aus. Das Strafmaß soll in den kommenden Tagen verkündet werden.\nDrei weitere Angeklagte, darunter der Hauptbeschuldigte Orlin Roussev, hatten die Vorwürfe bereits im vergangenen Jahr gestanden. Roussev war der Kontaktmann von Jan Marsalek, der die Gruppe im Auftrag Russlands führte und finanzierte. Tausende Textnachrichten belegen die Verbindung der beiden Männer.\nMarsalek, ehemaliger Wirecard-Vorstand und mutmaßlicher Milliardenbetrüger, stand in London nicht vor Gericht. Er ist im Sommer 2020 nach Russland geflohen.\nRecherchen der Süddeutschen Zeitung und des österreichischen Nachrichtenmagazins Profil legen den Verdacht nahe, dass der Manager schon während seiner Zeit bei Wirecard nicht nur Informationen für Russland gesammelt hat, sondern möglicherweise bereits damals Agenten im Auftrag Moskaus führte.\nIn London sind zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien der Verschwörung angeklagt. Sie sollen im Auftrag des früheren Wirecard-Managers Jan Marsalek für Russland spioniert haben. In dem Prozess nun geht es weniger um Staatsaffären als um Sex-Affären.

            "full_content": "VIENNA (AP) — Austrian authorities said Monday that they uncovered a Russian-steered campaign aimed at spreading disinformation about Ukraine following the detention in December of a Bulgarian woman accused of spying for Russia.\nAustria's domestic intelligence agency unearthed evidence of the operation as it analyzed devices found in a search of the woman's home, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It said the investigation showed that a few weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a cell working for Russian intelligence was set up and planned a large-scale disinformation campaign in German-speaking countries, particularly Austria.\nThe group was active online but also used stickers and graffiti with content such as far-right symbols and nationalist statements meant to look like pro-Ukrainian activists were responsible for them, according to the Interior Ministry.\nThe Bulgarian suspect, whose name wasn't released, is believed to have played a significant role in the effort and acted as an intelligence contact, the ministry said, adding that she has admitted working for the cell, particularly in 2022.\nA year ago, Austria's biggest espionage scandal in decades erupted with the arrest of a former Austrian intelligence officer, who was accused among other things of handing over cellphone data of former high-ranking Austrian officials to Russian intelligence and helping plot a burglary at a prominent journalist’s apartment.\nThe ex-officer, who was later released from custody, is suspected of having provided sensitive information to Jan Marsalek, a fugitive fellow Austrian wanted on suspicion of fraud since the collapse in 2020 of German payment company Wirecard, where he was the chief operating officer. The arrest warrant said chat messages provided by British authorities link Marsalek directly to Russia's FSB intelligence agency."

Nå er tre bulgarere funnet skyldige i spionasje i den britiske strandbyen Great Yarmouth. \nKatrin Ivanova (33), Vanya Gaberova (30) og Tihomir Ivantsjev (39) brukte avansert teknologi og falske identiteter for å samle informasjon om fiender av den russiske staten.\nDet beskrives som en av de største og mest komplekse fiendtlige operasjonene som noensinne er avdekket på britisk jord.\nNå er de tre spionene, som gikk under navnet «MinionsMinions betyr \"undersåtter\", \"håndlangere\" eller \"lakeier\" på engelsk.», dømt i domstolen Old BaileyOld Bailey er en kjent domstol i London som håndterer alvorlige straffesaker. i London. De er funnet skyldige i å ha drevet etterretningsvirksomhet i «industriell skala» som satte liv og nasjonal sikkerhet i fare, skriver Sky News.\nSpionene har tatt navnet fra de små gule karakterene i Grusomme meg-filmene, som jobber for en ondskapsfull oppfinner kalt Gru.\nGRU er den militære etterretningstjenesten i Russland, som samler inn og analyserer informasjon om andre land.\nFra et enormt sommerhus i Great Yarmouth, på østspissen av England, førte de operasjoner for å destabilisere vestlige demokratier. For eksempel dro de til Wien og Berlin, der de klistret opp høyreekstreme budskap og budskap kritiske mot Ukraina. \nEn av personene de samlet informasjon om, heter Christo Grozev.

Blant funnene var hjemmelagde lyd- og bildeopptagere skjult i hverdagslige gjenstander som en stein, slips, en Coca-Cola-flaske og en Minions-kosebamse.\nLondon-politiet har lagt ut en dramatisk video av arrestasjonene og raidet på gjestehuset i Great Yarmouth. Der ser man stabler med datautstyr og spionsaker. \n– Dette var spionasje i industriell skala på vegne av Russland. Jeg har aldri sett noe lignende i mine over 20 år i antiterror-arbeid. Det var en ekstremt sofistikert operasjon, sier antiterrorsjef i Metropolitan Police, kommandør Dominic Murphy, til Metro.\nDe tiltalte risikerer opptil 14 års fengsel for spionasjevirksomheten, som foregikk i Storbritannia, Østerrike, Spania, Tyskland og Montenegro.\n– Ved å målrette individer i Storbritannia som flykter fra forfølgelse, samt journalister som motsetter seg det russiske regimet, undergravde gruppen budskapet om at Storbritannia er et trygt land for disse menneskene, sier Frank Ferguson fra påtalemyndigheten til Evening Standard.\nDommen mot de tre kommer etter at ringelederen Orlin Roussev og hans nestkommanderende Biser Dzhambazov tidligere har erkjent skyld i spionasje. \nEn sjette person, Ivan Stoyanov (33), har også innrømmet å ha spionert for Russland.\nDe dømte vil få sine straffer mellom 7. og 12. mai.\nInformasjon om AI i VG-artikler\nEt kommersielt samarbeid med Kickback.no\nVG har ikke ansvar for innhold på eksterne nettsider som det lenkes til.

            "full_content": "In einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland sind in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden. Sie hätten im Auftrag von Jan Marsalek gehandelt, wie die Nachrichtenagentur PA gestern meldete.\nMarsalek, früher Vorstand des Finanzdienstleisters Wirecard, floh rechtzeitig zur Pleite des Milliardenkonzerns Richtung Russland. Wirecard implodierte da gerade wegen des Fehlens von rund zwei Milliarden Euro, ein mutmaßlicher Betrug, der derzeit vor einem Münchner Gericht verhandelt wird. Erst später wurde vermutet, dass Marsalek schon jahrelang für Russland spioniert hatte.\nLaut der Anklage, aus der der britische „Guardian“ zitierte, stand Marsalek an der Spitze des Spionagerings, deren drei Mitglieder nun in London verurteilt wurden.\nMit Hilfe des Mannes und der beiden Frauen, die wegen ihrer niederen Dienste „Minions“ genannt worden seien, habe Marsalek gemeinsam mit einem weiteren Anführer, Orlin Roussew, Personen und Orte, die für Russland interessant gewesen sein sollen, ausspioniert.\nThree UK-based Bulgarians found guilty of spying for Russia\n„Das war Spionage im industriellen Stil für Russland“, sagte der Anti-Terror-Chef der Londoner Polizei, Dominic Murphy. Es seien Beweismittel in dem Maße gefunden worden, wie man sie eigentlich in einem Spionageroman erwarten würde. Vor Gericht waren zudem romantische Dreiecksbeziehungen innerhalb der Spionagegruppe Thema.\nMarsalek habe seine Bandenmitglieder angewiesen, Handynummern ukrainischer Soldaten zu stehlen, die vermutlich in einer US-Kaserne in Stuttgart trainierten. Ein weiteres Spähopfer sei der damals noch in Wien lebende Investigativjournalist Christo Grosew gewesen. Ihm sei man nachgereist, man habe auch Überwachungskameras vor seiner Wohnung in Wien installiert. Mit Hilfe einer der beiden Frauen habe man sogar überlegt, Grosew in eine „Honeytrap“, eine Liebesfalle, zu locken. Auch eine Entführung wurde erwogen. Grosew verließ 2023 nach 20 Jahren Wien, weil man seine Sicherheit nicht gewährleisten konnte.\nMarsalek war selbst in London nicht angeklagt, er ist ohnehin untergetaucht. Roussew hatte sich bereits im Vorfeld des Prozesses schuldig bekannt, die drei jüngeren Mitglieder des Rings hatten den Spionagevorwurf aber bestritten. Daher kam es zum Prozess, der drei Monate dauerte. Den drei Bulgaren, die zuvor in London gelebt hatten, drohen Haftstrafen von bis zu 14 Jahren. Das Strafmaß soll noch verkündet werden.\nred, ORF.at/Agenturen"

            "full_content": "© Carsten Hoefer/epa Scanpix Sweden/dpa \nDie falschen Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns Wirecard wurden Jahr um Jahr von Wirtschaftsprüfern bestätigt. Eine Gerichtsentscheidung dämpft die Hoffnungen tausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz.\n28.02.2025, 14:41 Uhr\nEine erste Entscheidung des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts dämpft im Wirecard-Skandal die Hoffnungen zehntausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz. Im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahren können demnach keine Schadenersatzansprüche gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY vorgebracht werden, die die Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns bis zu dessen Kollaps im Sommer 2020 bestätigt hatten. \nDas verkündete Gerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt. Musterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil nannte die Entscheidung „hundertprozentig falsch“ und kündigte Beschwerde beim Bundesgerichtshof an. \nDas zivilrechtliche Musterverfahren vor dem Bayerischen Obersten Landesgericht läuft parallel zum Strafprozess, in dem sich Ex-Vorstandschef Markus Braun und zwei Mitangeklagte seit Dezember 2022 verantworten müssen. Auf Schadenersatz geklagt haben nach Worten der Richterin mittlerweile knapp 8.700 Anleger. Weitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. \nAls stellvertretenden Musterkläger hat der 1. Zivilsenat einen hessischen Bankkaufmann ausgewählt, der eine halbe Million Euro mit Wirecard-Papieren verloren hat. Eigentliche Zielscheibe der Kläger ist EY: Das Unternehmen ist solvent, während bei Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und Co. nach allgemeiner Einschätzung nichts mehr zu holen ist. \nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\n An dieser Stelle finden Sie einen von unseren Redakteuren ausgewählten, externen Inhalt, der den Artikel für Sie mit zusätzlichen Informationen anreichert.

Gemeint sind damit unter anderem falsche Bilanzen und falsche Pflichtmitteilungen an die Börse. \nEY hat jedoch nach Argumentation des Senats die falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen inklusive des EY-Bestätigungsvermerks nicht selbst veröffentlicht, sondern die Wirecard-Chefetage. Insofern sind Schadenersatzansprüche gegen EY im Musterverfahren laut Gericht „nicht statthaft“. \nDass die Wirecard-Bilanzen richtig gewesen wären, behauptet auch der frühere Vorstandschef Braun nicht: Der seit über viereinhalb Jahren in Untersuchungshaft sitzende Manager beschuldigt seinerseits eine Betrügerbande um den abgetauchten Ex-Vertriebsvorstand Jan Marsalek, dem Konzern Milliarden gestohlen zu haben. \nDie Entscheidung des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts bedeutet nicht, dass Wirecard-Aktionäre grundsätzlich nicht gegen EY klagen könnten. Doch Grundlage müsste nach Worten der Richterin die „Verletzung von Prüfpflichten“ sein, nicht die falsche Information des Kapitalmarkts. Die Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Braun und andere ehemalige Wirecard-Größen werden in dem Musterverfahren ohne Umweg über den BGH weiter verhandelt. „Es geht weiter“, sagte Schmidt. \nWeiter gehen werden auch die Klagen gegen EY, doch wird das Verfahren nun länger dauern. „Man muss sagen, es ist nochmal komplizierter geworden“, sagte Daniela Bergdolt, Vizepräsidentin der Anlegergemeinschaft DSW. „Das Verfahren wird auseinandergerissen.“ Die Entscheidung gebe den klagenden Wirecard-Aktionären „mehr Steine als Brot“. Musterkläger-Anwalt Mattil hofft, dass der BGH im nächsten Jahr über die Beschwerde entscheiden wird. \nSeit vergangenem Jahr ist nach den Worten des Anwalts im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz - kurz KapMUG genannt - ausdrücklich geregelt, dass auch Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Wirtschaftsprüfer geltend gemacht werden können. Da Wirecard schon 2020 Insolvenz anmeldete, gilt das nicht rückwirkend. Doch auch das ursprüngliche Gesetz lässt nach Mattils Überzeugung die Aufnahme der Schadenersatzforderungen gegen EY in das Musterverfahren zu. „Wir sind der Meinung, dass wir die viel stärkeren Argumente haben.“\nSollte der BGH anders entscheiden, könnte auf das Landgericht München I eine momentan eingefrorene Prozesslawine zukommen. Musterverfahren sollen eigentlich die Rechtsprechung beschleunigen: Ein einziger Prozess soll beispielhaft klären, ob Scharen von Klägern Anspruch auf Schadenersatz haben oder nicht. Anschließend müsste das Landgericht München I in den knapp 8.700 Verfahren jeweils „nur“ noch die individuellen Details abhandeln und entscheiden, ob und wieviel Geld jedem einzelnen Kläger zusteht. \nSolange das Musterverfahren läuft, sind die 8.700 Klagen ausgesetzt. Sofern die Kläger nicht scharenweise ihre Forderungen gegen EY zurücknehmen, müsste das Gericht wohl jeden Fall von Anfang an einzeln abarbeiten. \nDoch auch ein Musterverfahren garantiert keineswegs eine schnelle Entscheidung: Als Negativbeispiel gilt bis heute das Telekom-Verfahren, der erste Musterprozess in Deutschland. Dieser dauerte zwanzig Jahre, nach Schätzungen der DSW verstarben 30 Prozent der Kläger vor dem Ende des Verfahrens, einschließlich des ursprünglichen Musterklägers.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250228-930-389745/3\nDas ist eine Nachricht direkt aus dem dpa-Newskanal.\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster"

            "full_content": "Mai multe publicații britanice arată, după încheierea procesului spionilor ruși (cetățeni bulgari) prinși în UK, existența unei a doua rețele de spionaj rusești, coordonată de austriacul Jan Marsalek – fost director al companiei germane Wirecard (un fel de PayPal). Din 2020, când firma financiară a dat faliment, lăsând în urmă o pagubă de aproape două miliarde de euro, Marsalek, care a reușit să fugă din Austria cu un avion privat, este pe lista celor mai căutate persoane a Interpol.\nAcum, autoritățile britanice arată că acesta era un agent al spionajului militar rus, GRU, și coordona grupuri militare private (miliții de mercenari) responsabile de rutele de tranzit ale migranților din Africa, prin Libia, spre țările vest-europene.\nServiciile secrete occidentale au aflat că obiectivul agentului rus, avizat de un colonel din GRU, era formarea unei armate de 15 mii de mercenari care “să armonizeze fluxul de migranți, un obiectiv cheie al lui Vladimir Putin, problema fiind un factor major în alegerile din Europa”, arată The Telegraph. Nu este clar dacă acest obiectiv a fost atins, dar este o certitudine că imigrația a influențat puternic alegerile din țările UE. Partidele extremiste din Franța, Germania, Austria, Olanda și UK au folosit, într-adevăr, problema migrației pentru a câștiga popularitate și pentru a obține mai multe locuri în parlamentele europene, după 2020.\nDar dezvăluirile arată că Austria, una dintre cele mai vocale țări împotriva imigrației clandestine (a folosit acest pretext inclusiv pentru amânarea aderării României la Schengen), a fost pe punctul de a fi atrasă inclusiv într-o schemă de finanțare a acestor rețele de imigrație, deoarece Marsalek a încercat să îi convingă pe oficialii austrieci că o forță de mercenari ar putea să îi oprească în Libia pe cei care veneau din Africa spre țările europene.\n“Telegraph a avut acces la dovezi că, în 2017, oficialii guvernamentali austrieci au promis investiții de peste 120.000 de euro pentru a ajuta la realizarea planului, despre care Marsalek a spus că va ajuta UE să rezolve criza migrației. Cu toate acestea, planul era supervizat de un presupus colonel GRU. Avertismentele primite de oficialii guvernamentali din Germania și Austria cu privire la implicarea Rusiei în acest plan au fost ignorate”.\nMercenarii, inclusiv Wagner, au alimentat în realitate migrația din Africa, prin creșterea instabilității și violenței în teritoriile aflate sub controlul lor și prin mutarea fizică a migranților către granițele UE și sprijinirea traficanților. Potrivit unor surse de securitate, Marsalek a fost implicat în reorganizarea intereselor Wagner în Africa după moartea lui Evgheni Prigojin (în 2023). Dar planul lui Marsalek vine din 2017-2018, când el a avut întâlniri cu Killian Kleinschmidt, un fost lucrător ONU. La întâlnirile cu acesta a participat și Gustav Gustenau, pe atunci general în Ministerul Apărării din Austria. The Telegraph a avut acces la o declarație de intenție semnată de generalul austriac care promite 20.000 de euro pentru un plan “de stabilizare și management al migrației în Libia”. Dlui Kleinschmidt i s-au promis, de asemenea, încă 100 de mii de euro pentru proiectul de parteneriat public-privat prin Ministerul Federal al Transporturilor, Inovației și Tehnologiei din Austria, dar aceste plăți, aparent, nu s-au făcut. Generalul Gustenau a negat că ar fi făcut ceva greșit sau că ar fi avut o relație strânsă cu Marsalek, spunând că a fost autorizat de șefii săi să exploreze proiectul și că nu cunoștea legătura lui Marsalek cu Rusia.\nPlățile pentru proiect urmau să fie făcute de Marsalek prin intermediul “institutului cultural ruso-libian, care avea o adresă la Moscova. Nu există nicio înregistrare a unei astfel de companii”, arată publicația britanică.\nDezvăluirile vin într-un moment cheie al războiului din Ucraina, Donald Trump făcând presiuni asupra lui Volodimir Zelenski să negocieze o pace cu Rusia. Dar liderii europeni au avertizat anterior că Occidentul s-ar putea confrunta cu un nou val de migranți dacă Ucraina cade în mâinile Rusiei.\nSurse: The Telegraph, Reuters\nEchipa Biziday nu a solicitat și nu a acceptat nicio formă de finanțare din fonduri guvernamentale.

            "full_content": "© Carsten Hoefer/epa Scanpix Sweden/dpa \nDie falschen Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns Wirecard wurden Jahr um Jahr von Wirtschaftsprüfern bestätigt. Eine Gerichtsentscheidung dämpft die Hoffnungen tausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz.\n28.02.2025, 14:41 Uhr\nEine erste Entscheidung des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts dämpft im Wirecard-Skandal die Hoffnungen zehntausender Aktionäre auf Schadenersatz. Im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahren können demnach keine Schadenersatzansprüche gegen die Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft EY vorgebracht werden, die die Bilanzen des Skandalkonzerns bis zu dessen Kollaps im Sommer 2020 bestätigt hatten. \nDas verkündete Gerichtspräsidentin Andrea Schmidt. Musterklägeranwalt Peter Mattil nannte die Entscheidung „hundertprozentig falsch“ und kündigte Beschwerde beim Bundesgerichtshof an. \nDas zivilrechtliche Musterverfahren vor dem Bayerischen Obersten Landesgericht läuft parallel zum Strafprozess, in dem sich Ex-Vorstandschef Markus Braun und zwei Mitangeklagte seit Dezember 2022 verantworten müssen. Auf Schadenersatz geklagt haben nach Worten der Richterin mittlerweile knapp 8.700 Anleger. Weitere 19.000 haben Ansprüche angemeldet, ohne selbst zu klagen. \nAls stellvertretenden Musterkläger hat der 1. Zivilsenat einen hessischen Bankkaufmann ausgewählt, der eine halbe Million Euro mit Wirecard-Papieren verloren hat. Eigentliche Zielscheibe der Kläger ist EY: Das Unternehmen ist solvent, während bei Ex-Vorstandschef Braun und Co. nach allgemeiner Einschätzung nichts mehr zu holen ist. \nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\n An dieser Stelle finden Sie einen von unseren Redakteuren ausgewählten, externen Inhalt, der den Artikel für Sie mit zusätzlichen Informationen anreichert.

Gemeint sind damit unter anderem falsche Bilanzen und falsche Pflichtmitteilungen an die Börse. \nEY hat jedoch nach Argumentation des Senats die falschen Wirecard-Bilanzen inklusive des EY-Bestätigungsvermerks nicht selbst veröffentlicht, sondern die Wirecard-Chefetage. Insofern sind Schadenersatzansprüche gegen EY im Musterverfahren laut Gericht „nicht statthaft“. \nDass die Wirecard-Bilanzen richtig gewesen wären, behauptet auch der frühere Vorstandschef Braun nicht: Der seit über viereinhalb Jahren in Untersuchungshaft sitzende Manager beschuldigt seinerseits eine Betrügerbande um den abgetauchten Ex-Vertriebsvorstand Jan Marsalek, dem Konzern Milliarden gestohlen zu haben. \nDie Entscheidung des Bayerischen Obersten Landesgerichts bedeutet nicht, dass Wirecard-Aktionäre grundsätzlich nicht gegen EY klagen könnten. Doch Grundlage müsste nach Worten der Richterin die „Verletzung von Prüfpflichten“ sein, nicht die falsche Information des Kapitalmarkts. Die Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Braun und andere ehemalige Wirecard-Größen werden in dem Musterverfahren ohne Umweg über den BGH weiter verhandelt. „Es geht weiter“, sagte Schmidt. \nWeiter gehen werden auch die Klagen gegen EY, doch wird das Verfahren nun länger dauern. „Man muss sagen, es ist nochmal komplizierter geworden“, sagte Daniela Bergdolt, Vizepräsidentin der Anlegergemeinschaft DSW. „Das Verfahren wird auseinandergerissen.“ Die Entscheidung gebe den klagenden Wirecard-Aktionären „mehr Steine als Brot“. Musterkläger-Anwalt Mattil hofft, dass der BGH im nächsten Jahr über die Beschwerde entscheiden wird. \nSeit vergangenem Jahr ist nach den Worten des Anwalts im Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz - kurz KapMUG genannt - ausdrücklich geregelt, dass auch Schadenersatzansprüche gegen Wirtschaftsprüfer geltend gemacht werden können. Da Wirecard schon 2020 Insolvenz anmeldete, gilt das nicht rückwirkend. Doch auch das ursprüngliche Gesetz lässt nach Mattils Überzeugung die Aufnahme der Schadenersatzforderungen gegen EY in das Musterverfahren zu. „Wir sind der Meinung, dass wir die viel stärkeren Argumente haben.“\nSollte der BGH anders entscheiden, könnte auf das Landgericht München I eine momentan eingefrorene Prozesslawine zukommen. Musterverfahren sollen eigentlich die Rechtsprechung beschleunigen: Ein einziger Prozess soll beispielhaft klären, ob Scharen von Klägern Anspruch auf Schadenersatz haben oder nicht. Anschließend müsste das Landgericht München I in den knapp 8.700 Verfahren jeweils „nur“ noch die individuellen Details abhandeln und entscheiden, ob und wieviel Geld jedem einzelnen Kläger zusteht. \nSolange das Musterverfahren läuft, sind die 8.700 Klagen ausgesetzt. Sofern die Kläger nicht scharenweise ihre Forderungen gegen EY zurücknehmen, müsste das Gericht wohl jeden Fall von Anfang an einzeln abarbeiten. \nDoch auch ein Musterverfahren garantiert keineswegs eine schnelle Entscheidung: Als Negativbeispiel gilt bis heute das Telekom-Verfahren, der erste Musterprozess in Deutschland. Dieser dauerte zwanzig Jahre, nach Schätzungen der DSW verstarben 30 Prozent der Kläger vor dem Ende des Verfahrens, einschließlich des ursprünglichen Musterklägers.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250228-930-389745/3\nDas ist eine Nachricht direkt aus dem dpa-Newskanal.\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster"

            "full_content": "O a doua operaţiune de spionaj a Kremlinului vizând disidenţi ruşi a fost descoperită în Marea Britanie, dezvăluie duminică The Observer, citat de News.ro, după ce săptămâna aceasta mai mulţi cetăţeni bulgari din reţeaua fugarului Jan Marsalek au fost condamnaţi pentru spionaj în favoarea Kremlinului.\nRoman Dobrohotov, un jurnalist aflat în vizorul celor şase bulgari condamnaţi pentru spionaj în favoarea Rusiei, a declarat că a fost informat despre noi tentative de supraveghere a familiei sale. Jurnalistul rus de investigaţii Roman Dobrohotov a fugit din Rusia în 2021 şi de atunci se teme pentru viaţa sa. Dobrohotov este redactorul-şef al site-ului Insider, a cărui activitate de investigaţie a dus la aplicarea de sancţiuni economice de către Occident pentru aproximativ 80 de companii şi 60 de persoane din cauza rolului lor în facilitarea războiului lui Vladimir Putin în Ucraina.\n„Am primit un avertisment de la poliţie primăvara trecută”, a declarat Dobrohotov, care are 41 de ani şi care s-a mutat în Marea Britanie în ianuarie 2023. „Aceste încercări sunt în curs de desfăşurare”, a menţionat el.\nDetaliile avertismentului dat lui Dobrohotov nu sunt dezvăluite la cererea acestuia, precizează The Observer. La fel, nu este precizat nici unde locuieşte împreună cu soţia sa, Katia, şi cu cei doi fii ai lor, în vârstă de 8 şi 10 ani.\nŞase cetăţeni bulgari cu statut de rezident în Regatul Unit – Vania Gaberova, 30 de ani, Katrin Ivanova, 33 de ani, Tihomir Ivancev, 39 de ani, Orlin Roussev, 47 de ani, Biser Djambazov, 43 de ani, şi Ivan Stoianov, 34 de ani – au fost condamnaţi în Marea Britanie – trei dintre ei chiar săptămâna aceasta – pentru efectuarea de operaţiuni de spionaj în ţară şi în străinătate.\nJan Marsalek, 44 de ani, un cetăţean austriac despre care se crede că este agent rus, a condus de la Moscova operaţiunea de spionaj din Marea Britanie. El este căutat internaţional pentru o presupusă fraudă de 1,9 miliarde de euro la compania financiară germană Wirecard, aflată în faliment.\nDouă dintre ţintele reţelei lui Jan Marsalek au fost jurnaliştii Hristo Grozev şi Roman Dobrohotov, care i-au demascat pe cei doi ofiţeri ai serviciilor militare de informaţii ale Rusiei care au încercat să îi ucidă pe Serghei Skripal şi pe fiica sa, Iulia, în Salisbury în 2018.\nMesaje descoperite de poliţie arată că Dobrohotov a fost urmărit atât de îndeaproape, încât codul PIN al iPhone-ului său a fost preluat de unul dintre spionii care stăteau lângă el într-un avion.\nAu existat, de asemenea, discuţii în cadrul grupului cu privire la otrăvirea lui Dobrohotov cu ricin pe străzile din Londra sau răpirea acestuia cu ajutorul unei ambarcaţiuni mici.\nAvertismentul poliţiei cu privire la o nouă încercare de a-l viza pe Dobrohotov a venit la câteva luni după arestarea reţelei de spioni, în februarie 2024.\n„Am înţeles că, după arestarea bulgarilor, trebuie să existe în continuare o atenţie continuă faţă de mine şi Hristo, deoarece nu ne-am oprit activitatea. De asemenea, sursa noastră ne-a spus că, după ce această echipă controlată de FSB (serviciul de securitate al Rusiei) a fost arestată, sarcina – aceeaşi sarcină – este acum încredinţată GRU (serviciile militare de informaţii). Ne aşteptam ca aşa ceva să continue. Deci, după ce poliţia a spus că ştie despre noi tentative, nu a fost foarte surprinzător, ci doar o confirmare a ceea ce ne spunea şi sursa noastră rusă”, a declarat Dobrohotov.\nJurnalistul a mărturisit că trebuie să fie în continuă mişcare pentru a încerca să se sustragă atenţiei Kremlinului.\n„Toată familia mea este îngrijorată, desigur. Îşi fac griji pentru mine şi înţeleg că nu sunt în siguranţă – dacă pun noviciok (agentul biologic folosit în tentativa de asasinat asupra lui Skripal) pe mânerul uşii, toţi pot suferi. Pe de altă parte, cea mai urâtă situaţie este când nu ştii dacă ar trebui să fii foarte îngrijorat sau dacă te poţi relaxa. Întotdeauna te îndoieşti, dacă eşti paranoic, cu privire la toate aceste lucruri. Deci, într-un fel, este bine să ştii că eşti la curent cu această situaţie”, a explicat Dobrohotov.\n„Poliţia antiteroristă lucrează îndeaproape cu forţele de poliţie, cu partenerii şi comunităţile pentru a identifica orice activitate represivă a statelor străine în Regatul Unit şi va încerca să întrerupă această activitate acolo unde este posibil. S-a dovedit a fi fost cazul într-o serie de arestări recente şi acuzaţii care au fost făcute în legătură cu infracţiuni în temeiul Legii privind securitatea naţională”, a precizat un purtător de cuvânt al poliţiei antiteroriste britanice.\n„Încurajăm membrii publicului să raporteze orice acuzaţii de interferenţă străină către forţele de poliţie locale. La primirea unor astfel de rapoarte, ofiţerii vor evalua dacă există preocupări sau probleme de protecţie sau de securitate şi, în colaborare cu ofiţerii specializaţi, vor fi în măsură să ofere persoanelor afectate consiliere şi sprijin adecvat în materie de siguranţă şi securitate, după caz. Şedinţele de informare privind siguranţa personală nu reprezintă limita activităţii noastre de a menţine oamenii în siguranţă, însă acestea creează legături directe între persoane, organizaţii şi poliţie. Importanţa acestor sfaturi nu ar trebui să fie subestimată şi nici amploarea activităţii operaţionale care are loc în cadrul echipelor noastre de investigaţii proactive şi cu agenţiile partenere pentru a menţine siguranţa oamenilor”, a transmis poliţia.\nHotNews.ro utilizează cookie-uri pentru a\n                        îmbunătăți experiența dvs.\nAccesați Modifică Setările pentru\n                    preferințe și consultați Politica de confidențialitate.\nContinuarea navigării implică acceptarea Termenilor și Condițiilor.\n                \n© HotNews.ro 2006-2024"

Sie seien Teil einer Einheit des mutmaßlichen russischen Spions und früheren Wirecard-Vorstands Jan Marsalek gewesen und hätten in verschiedenen Teilen Europas Überwachungsmaßnahmen vorgenommen, gegen Einzelpersonen und auch einen US-Militärstützpunkt, urteilte das Gericht. Die Angeklagten hatten auf nicht schuldig plädiert.\n\nMarsalek fungierte dem Urteil zufolge als Vermittler zwischen dem russischen Geheimdienst und dem Anführer des Spionagerings.

In dem Londoner Prozess war Marsalek nicht selbst angeklagt.\n\nNach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft war der Spionagering an sechs größeren Operationen beteiligt. Neben dem US-Militärstützpunkt bei Stuttgart sei auch der Journalist Christo Grosew ein Ziel gewesen. Dieser hatte für die investigative Website Bellingcat gearbeitet und dort unter anderem über die Vergiftung des russischen Doppelagenten Sergei Skripal 2018 in Salisbury berichtet. Auch Roman Dobrochotow, Chefredakteur des Investigativmediums The Insider, sowie der ehemalige kasachische Politiker Bergey Ryskaliyew, der inzwischen Asyl in Großbritannien erhalten hat, und der russische Dissident Kiril Kachur wurden ins Visier genommen. \n\nDer Prozess am Londoner Central Criminal Court hatte im November begonnen. Das Strafmaß soll im Mai verkündet werden. Den verurteilten Spionen drohen Haftstrafen von bis zu 14 Jahren.

            "full_content": "A Rússia acusou dois diplomatas britânicos na segunda-feira de espionagem e deu a eles duas semanas para deixarem o país, reforçando a trajetória descendente das relações diplomáticas de Moscou com a Europa, mesmo enquanto negocia a restauração dos laços com os Estados Unidos. \n\n O Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Reino Unido rejeitou as alegações contra seus diplomatas como \"infundadas\".\n Moscou ficou irritada com o apoio militar contínuo do Reino Unido à Ucrânia e com as recentes declarações do primeiro-ministro Keir Starmer sobre a colocação de botas britânicas no solo e aviões no ar na Ucrânia como parte de uma possível força de manutenção da paz.\n As expulsões também ocorrem dias depois que três búlgaros foram considerados culpados em um tribunal de Londres por fazerem parte de uma unidade de espionagem russa dirigida pelo fugitivo da Wirecard Jan Marsalek, para realizar vigilância em uma base militar dos EUA e contra outros indivíduos visados por Moscou.\n Os dois britânicos parecem ser os primeiros diplomatas ocidentais a serem expulsos da Rússia desde que Moscou e Washington iniciaram conversações para restaurar o quadro de funcionários de suas respectivas embaixadas, que foram reduzidas por expulsões retaliatórias, parte da reaproximação de Donald Trump com o Kremlin que tem alarmado os aliados europeus.\n Expulsões semelhantes reduziram drasticamente o funcionamento das embaixadas russas em todo o Ocidente e de missões ocidentais na Rússia desde que o presidente Vladimir Putin enviou dezenas de milhares de soldados para a Ucrânia em 2022.\n O Serviço Federal de Segurança da Rússia disse que os dois diplomatas britânicos haviam fornecido informações falsas ao obter permissão para entrar no país e que \"identificou sinais de inteligência e trabalho subversivo\" que eles haviam realizado, prejudicando a segurança russa.\n O Kremlin afirmou que os serviços de inteligência da Rússia estavam fazendo todo o necessário para proteger a segurança nacional.\n Em resposta à decisão de Moscou, o Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Reino Unido disse em um comunicado: \"Esta não é a primeira vez que a Rússia faz acusações maliciosas e infundadas contra nossa equipe\".\n O Ministério das Relações Exteriores da Rússia disse que convocou um representante da embaixada britânica sobre as expulsões e reclamou que os diplomatas eram funcionários \"não declarados\" dos serviços de inteligência do Reino Unido, algo que Moscou não toleraria.\n O ministério declarou que \"responderá da mesma forma\" se Londres decidir agora \"escalar\" a situação.\n As relações entre Reino Unido e Rússia caíram para o nível mais baixo pós-Guerra Fria desde o início da guerra na Ucrânia. O Reino Unido aderiu a sucessivas ondas de sanções contra a Rússia e forneceu armas à Ucrânia."

En ellas había alusiones hitlerianas y consignas de extrema derecha contra Rusia que se repetían también en  ... pegatinas adheridas durante la noche a los coches aparcados y en octavillas introducidas en los buzones de las casas. \nParalelamente, en las redes sociales, burbujeaban cuentas en las que grupos a favor de Zelenski proclamaban la autoría de esta campaña. Hoy sabemos que fue una operación rusa de desinformación. \nLa Dirección de Seguridad e Inteligencia del Estado (DSN), el servicio de secreto interior de Austria, ha descubierto «una extensa campaña de desinformación rusa en Austria» llevada a cabo por una célula rusa que ya estaba establecida en el país con anterioridad y que fue activada en ese momento y con esa misión.\nEl descubrimiento de este ataque híbrido ha sido posible después del registro en diciembre de la vivienda de un sospechoso de nacionalidad búlgara. El análisis de sus dispositivos móviles y discos duros incautados permitió acceder al diseño de una campaña dirigida desde Rusia y ejecutada por «una célula que trabajaba para el servicio secreto ruso». Su objetivo: «volver contra el gobierno ucraniano a las opiniones públicas de los países de habla alemana, centrándose en primer lugar en Austria». \n«La difusión de narrativas falsas, noticias falsas y contenidos manipuladores socava la confianza en nuestras instituciones y pone en peligro la cohesión social», ha declarado tras la identificación de estos mensajes fraudulentos el secretario de Estado Jörg Leichtfried. Además, ha advertido de que la difusión de desinformación «tiene el potencial de influir en las elecciones, promover la inestabilidad política y poner en peligro la sociedad democrática». \n«No debemos permitir que la formación de opinión en la política y en la opinión pública sea controlada desde el exterior. Nosotros, los austriacos, preferimos formarnos nuestras propias opiniones», ha señalado Leichtfried.\nLos servicios de inteligencia europeos deben contar con la existencia de otras células dormidas en diferentes países, esperando para influir en la opinión pública de acuerdo a los intereses rusos. \nEn el caso de la campaña austriaca se intentaba corromper la figura del presidente de Ucrania, Volodímir Zelenski, y generar indirectamente un sentimiento prorruso. «Para lograrlo, recurrieron a actividades en el panorama mediático en internet, así como a las acciones en la vida real, con pegatinas o grafitis cuyo diseño pretendía dar la impresión de que los activistas proucranianos eran los autores y creadores», confirma el Ministerio de Interior de Austria. \n«Se utilizaron motivos de diseño y lingüísticos, que son inmediatamente rechazados por el público en general en este país, sobre todo el simbolismo de extrema derecha y las declaraciones y cifras nacionalistas», explica.\nDe acuerdo con la información actualmente disponible, el sospechoso búlgaro había hecho varias veces el papel de persona de contacto de la inteligencia. También es probable que los servicios secretos rusos proporcionasen a la célula el material y contenidos que debían distribuir en Alemania y Austria. Hay pruebas de que material similar fue enviado a cómplices que en ese momento se encontraban en Rusia y en Inglaterra, por lo que el caso podría estar relacionado con las dos mujeres y un hombre de Bulgaria declarados recientemente culpables en un espectacular caso de espionaje para el Kremlin en Londres. \nPresumiblemente, actuaban en nombre del exmiembro de la junta directiva de Wirecard, Jan Marsalek. El sospechoso detenido en Austria ha confesado haber trabajado para la célula, especialmente en 2022.\nEstos hallazgos son los flecos del caso que hace un año demostró que la inteligencia rusa estaba infiltrada hasta lo más profundo en la seguridad de Austria, el expediente de Egisto Ott. \nEsta trama, que muestra las agresivas acciones rusas en el corazón de Europa como preparación de la guerra de Ucrania, tiene unos protagonistas de película de suspense. Entre ellos, destacan un exagente del contraespionaje austriaco, un importante periodista de investigación, una red de agentes rusos y otro austriaco prófugo que orquestaba desde Rusia operaciones para el Kremlin.\nEgisto Ott recabó durante años información sobre opositores al régimen de Putin refugiados en Europa, incluidos exmiembros de los servicios de inteligencia rusos FSB con nuevas identidades, así como de políticos y periodistas. A pesar de que fue suspendido en 2017 de la Oficina Federal para la Protección de la Constitución y Contra el Terrorismo (BVT), el exagente siguió accediendo a información confidencial sobre movimientos de personas que Moscú quería localizar. \nJan Marsalek, exnúmero dos del quebrado sistema de pago digital Wirecard, que huyó a Rusia tras desvelarse un fraude de 1.900 millones de euros a mediados de 2020, ha estado desde entonces asesorando a la inteligencia rusa. \nUno de sus primeros objetivos fue el periodista de investigación austriaco Christo Grozev. Otro de sus grandes logros, hacerse con un dispositivo SINA, una de las máquinas criptográficas más avanzadas utilizadas en Occidente. En paralelo a estas misiones, organizaron una célula cuya misión era convencer a los austriacos de que la invasión rusa de Ucrania era una guerra contra el fascismo.\n\nVer comentarios\n(0)\n\nEsta funcionalidad es sólo para suscriptores\n\n\nUna meteoróloga se adelanta a la Aemet y dice cómo será el tiempo para Semana Santa en España: «Este año esperamos...»\n\n\n\n\nLos mejores calefactores de bajo consumo A +++\n\n\nAlgunos campos contienen errores\nTu mensaje se ha enviado con éxito\nAlgunos campos contienen errores\nTu mensaje se ha enviado con éxito\nMuchas gracias por tu participación"

Dabei gehe es vorwiegend um dessen Verbindungen zum flüchtigen Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Jan Marsalek, berichtete das Ö1-„Mittagsjournal“ am Dienstag. Otts Anwalt sieht einer möglichen Anklage gelassen entgegen. Man sei zuversichtlich, auch im Rahmen eines möglichen Gerichtsverfahrens darzulegen, dass Ott unschuldig sei.\nOtt musste sich erst kürzlich vor Gericht verantworten, wurde aber freigesprochen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft legte dagegen Rechtsmittel ein. Ihm war vorgeworfen worden, dem ehemaligen FPÖ-Nationalratsabgeordneten Hans-Jörg Jenewein Informationen über ein Treffen des sogenannten Berner Clubs beschafft und ihm eine Liste mit Namen von BVT-Beamten übermittelt zu haben. Man habe nicht feststellen können, ob diese Infos tatsächlich aus internen Quellen gestammt hätten, lautete die Urteilsbegründung.\nDer Prozess gegen Ott und Jenewein - er wurde zu anderen Vorwürfen nicht rechtskräftig schuldig gesprochen - bildete quasi nur eine Art Nebenstrang zu anderen Vorwürfen gegen den Ex-BVT-Beamten. Gegen Ott wird seit 2017 wegen Amtsmissbrauchs, geheimen Nachrichtendiensts zum Nachteil Österreichs und weiterer Delikte ermittelt. Am 29. März 2024 wurde er deshalb fest- und bis zum 26. Juni desselben Jahres in U-Haft genommen.\nGegenüber Ö1 bestätigte die Staatsanwaltschaft Wien, dass nun ein Vorhabensbericht fertiggestellt sei. Aus Beweisgründen eingestellt wurden laut „Falter“ hingegen Ermittlungen gegen eine hohe Beamtin aus dem Innenministerium, die vertrauliche Informationen wie etwa ein digitales Personalverzeichnis des Ministeriums an Ott geliefert haben soll. Eine Kopie davon sei auf einem USB-Stick bei Jenewein gefunden worden.  (APA)\n>>> Berichrt im Ö1-„Mittagsjournal“"

            "full_content": "Bei einer Hausdurchsuchung stießen Ermittler der DSN auf eine Zelle, die mutmaßlich für den russischen Geheimdienst tätig war. Häufig gaben sie sich als pro-ukrainische Aktivisten aus.\n24.03.2025, 13:24 Uhr\nIn Österreich haben Ermittler des Verfassungsschutzes eine umfangreiche russische Desinformationskampagne aufgedeckt. Im Zentrum der Ermittlungen steht eine bulgarische Staatsangehörige, die verdächtigt wird, im Auftrag Russlands Spionage betrieben und aktiv an der Verbreitung gezielter Falschinformationen gegen die Ukraine mitgewirkt zu haben. Das teilte die beim Innenministerium angesiedelte Direktion für Staatsschutz und Nachrichtendienst (DSN) am Montag mit. Ziel der Kampagne sei es gewesen, die öffentliche und politische Meinung zugunsten Russlands und zum Nachteil der Ukraine zu beeinflussen. Die Verdächtige sei geständig, insbesondere im Jahr 2022 für die Zelle tätig gewesen zu sein.\nLaut der österreichischen Nachrichtenagentur APA befindet sich die verdächtigte Frau derzeit auf freiem Fuß. Sie habe auch bestätigt, Verbindungen zu einer mutmaßlichen Zelle zu haben, die in Großbritannien im Auftrag des ehemaligen Wirecard-Vorstands Jan Marsalek operiere, berichtete die Agentur unter Berufung auf eine Sprecherin von Staatssekretär Jörg Leichtfried aus dem Innenministerium. Die Sprecherin war vorerst nicht für eine Stellungnahme gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters zu erreichen.\nBei einer Hausdurchsuchung der Verdächtigen stießen Ermittler der DSN eigenen Angaben zufolge auf eine Zelle, die mutmaßlich für den russischen Geheimdienst tätig war. Die Auswertung der sichergestellten Datenträger habe ergeben, dass diese Gruppe bereits wenige Wochen nach Beginn des russischen Angriffskrieges auf die Ukraine aktiv wurde. Anfang 2022 plante sie eine breit angelegte Desinformationskampagne für den deutschsprachigen Raum, mit Schwerpunkt Österreich. Dabei kamen sowohl Online-Methoden als auch Offline-Aktionen zum Einsatz – etwa durch die Verbreitung von Aufklebern und Graffiti. Die Gestaltung dieser Aktionen sollte den Eindruck erwecken, dass pro-ukrainische Aktivisten dahintersteckten.\n„Die Verbreitung von falschen Narrativen, Fake News und manipulativen Inhalten untergräbt das Vertrauen in unsere Institutionen und gefährdet den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt“, sagte Staatssekretär Leichtfried. Desinformation könne Wahlen beeinflussen, politische Instabilität fördern und die demokratische Gesellschaft insgesamt gefährden.

            "full_content": "Wie das vermeintliche Einhorn E-Fishery aus Indonesien renommierte Investoren täuschte und die Schwächen der globalen Startup-Branche offenlegte.\nDie Story, die das Startup-Unternehmen E-Fishery den Investoren auftischte, schien nachhaltig, traf den Zeitgeist und klang vermutlich zu gut, um kritisch hinterfragt zu werden. Der vielversprechende Agrartechnologie-Innovator erreichte eine Bewertung von zuletzt 1,4 Milliarden Dollar und liess sich als neues Unicorn aus Indonesien feiern. Doch der Schwindel flog auf und mahnt dazu, genauer hinzuschauen.\n\n        NZZ.ch benötigt JavaScript für wichtige Funktionen. Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan.\n      \nBitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\nDas Startup E-Fishery aus Indonesien bediente genau jene Sehnsüchte, die man mit dem riesigen Schwellenland verbindet: eine technikaffine, junge Gesellschaft in einer aufstrebenden Demokratie, schlummerndes Marktpotenzial, Skaleneffekte dank Digitalisierung, ein nachhaltiger Primärsektor.\nIndonesien, dieser verlockende Archipel am Äquator, der schon den niederländischen Kaufleuten seinerzeit ungeahnten Reichtum bescherte, zählt heute doppelt so viele Konsumenten wie Russland.\nVor 25 Jahren schüttelte es aus eigener Kraft die Suharto-Diktatur ab, unlängst wurde ein Freihandelsabkommen mit den Efta-Staaten geschlossen. Auch für global aufgestellte Beteiligungsgesellschaften wie Temasek und Softbank galt Indonesien als ein heisses Investitionsziel in Südostasien. Die Suche nach dem nächsten grossen Ding ergab also vielleicht Sinn.\nUnd zu einer maritimen Nation, deren Gewässer 70 Prozent der Staatsfläche ausmachen und die über schier unendliche Küsten verfügt, passte eigentlich nichts besser als eine Aquakultur-Erfolgsstory.\nE-Fishery ist eine auf kleine Züchter ausgerichtete Geschäftsidee, die intelligent gesteuerte Fütterungstechnik, digitale Überwachung, Marktzugang und Finanzierung im Gesamtpaket anbietet.\nKürzlich sorgte E-Fishery jedoch für Schlagzeilen. Ein Whistleblower machte auf betrügerische Machenschaften und fingierte Geschäftszahlen des Unternehmens aufmerksam.\nDer Finanzmarktaufsicht in Jakarta, der indonesischen Polizei sowie einer mit Abklärungen betrauten amerikanischen Prüfungsgesellschaft liegen klare Hinweise für systematisch manipulierte Finanzzahlen ab 2017 vor. Dazu kommen erfundene Lieferketten, wie man sie aus dem Wirecard-Skandal kennt, die bloss dem «round-tripping» dienten: Umsatzzahlen also, die durch Geldtransfers von Scheinfirmen kreislaufmässig aufgeblasen wurden.\nZwar wird noch ermittelt, doch der Fall hat die Startup-Szene bereits durchgeschüttelt, und der Reputationsschaden beschränkt sich nicht auf Indonesien.\nDas Erstaunliche an dem Fall ist, dass selbst versierte institutionelle Investoren dem Zahlenschwindel von E-Fishery auf den Leim gegangen sind. Die Betrugsmasche nährte sich damit selbst: Die Erfolgsstory wurde immer glaubhafter, weil über Jahre hinweg namhafte internationale Geldgeber angelockt wurden. Es entwickelte sich eine Eigendynamik: Keiner wollte den Schnellzug verpassen.\nInvestitionen in Ernährungstechnologien sind interessant. Fisch und Seafood sind Alternativen zu Fleisch, die globale Bevölkerung wächst weiter, vor allem in Asien, und damit auch der Bedarf an Protein. Alleine die Zahlen zu Shrimps sind gigantisch: Etwa 440 Milliarden Garnelen werden weltweit jährlich gezüchtet.\nDas Aquatech-Startup E-Fishery, das Aufzuchtmethoden revolutionierte, Nachhaltigkeit versprach und Hunderttausenden Kleinunternehmern eine Perspektive bot, war weltweit ein Novum.\nIn Indonesien sowie bei Investoren, die das Land auf dem Radar hatten, herrschte Euphorie: Im Mai 2023 konnte sich E-Fishery in einer vierten Finanzierungsrunde über 200 Millionen Dollar beschaffen, womit die Bewertung auf 1,4 Milliarden Dollar hochschnellte. Zu den Geldgebern gehörten renommierte Staatsfonds wie Temasek (Singapur) und 42XFund (Abu Dhabi), der malaysische Pensionsfonds KWAP, klassische Startup-Financiers wie Softbank und Northstar sowie der niederländische Branchenspezialist Aqua-Spark. 2022 und 2024 gewährten auch die indonesischen Ableger der Banken DBS und HSBC Kredite im zweistelligen Millionenbereich.\nGegründet wurde E-Fishery 2013 von den zwei Jungunternehmern Gibran Huzaifah und Chrisna Aditya. Beide aus einfachem Haus, aber klug, talentiert und ambitioniert. Die Idee, da waren sich Branchenexperten und die ersten Investoren einig, überzeugte: Moderne Technologie garantiert effiziente Fütterungs- und Überwachungssysteme (E-Feeder), dank Apps und digitalen Marktplätzen werden – ähnlich den etablierten E-Commerce-Plattformen – Markttransparenz und Finanzierungskanäle auch für Kleinstanbieter geschaffen. Ein neues Ökosystem rund um Aquakulturen schien geboren.\nZu Manipulationen kam es laut vorliegenden Abklärungen bereits 2017. Um dem Hype und dem steigenden Finanzbedarf zu genügen, wurden fortan zwei getrennte Bücher geführt: eines für den internen Gebrauch, ein anderes mit aufgeblähten Umsatz- und Erfolgszahlen. Damit imponierten die Gründer den Investoren, den Medien und anderen Stakeholdern.\nDas Geschäft von E-Fishery wuchs zwar, doch blieb es unter den hochgeschraubten Erwartungen. In der Folge wurde die Diskrepanz mit jedem Jahr grösser: 2024 wurden statt 24 000 aktiver E-Feeder 400 000 ausgewiesen, statt eines Umsatzes von 157 Millionen Dollar stand gegen aussen 752 Millionen im Buch. Und die ausgewiesenen Gewinne im zweistelligen Millionenbereich waren in Realität Millionenverluste in ähnlichem Umfang.\nSieben Jahre lang konnten die beiden Gründer die Investoren, die zwei Auditoren PwC und Grant Thornton sowie die Fachpresse mit fingierten Zahlen hinters Licht führen.\nTom Ludescher, ein Fintech-Experte in Südostasien, sieht Parallelen zum Wirecard-Skandal. Beide Fälle würden auf ein Kernproblem westlicher Investitionsstrategien in Asien hinweisen: eine unzureichende Due Diligence. Die Jagd nach Renditen in einem globalen Umfeld mit niedrigen Zinsen habe dazu geführt, dass Investoren mehr auf Wachstumshoffnungen als auf solide Fundamentaldaten setzen würden. Die mangelnde Transparenz in vielen asiatischen Märkten, gepaart mit institutionellen Schwächen in der Finanzaufsicht, verstärkt diese Dynamik.\nJörg Wolle ist der Verwaltungsratspräsident von Kühne + Nagel, der auch Temasek, einem der betroffenen Staatsfonds, durch seinen Einsitz im International Advisory Network verbunden ist. Für ihn erscheint der Fall aus mehreren Gründen symptomatisch. Auch er warnt davor, dass gute «Startup-Geschichten» oft zu wenig hinterfragt werden. Wenn ein Hype entstehe, werde in den Chefetagen ungeduldig gefragt, wieso man nicht mitmache. Bei den Mitarbeitern fehle dann oft der Mut, sich querzustellen, auf mehr Transparenz zu pochen und traditionelle Investitionsgrundsätze in Erinnerung zu rufen.\nJörg Wolle zeigt sich skeptisch gegenüber Indonesien. Das Land stehe tendenziell zu hoch im Kurs, sagt er. Das habe auch mit dem gegenwärtigen «China-Bashing» zu tun. Die südostasiatischen Länder (Asean), unter denen Indonesien grössenmässig eine Sonderstellung hat, wiesen derzeit zwar eindrückliche Wachstumszahlen aus.\nAber wer im Asean-Raum nach Perspektiven und Alternativen zu China suche, finde heute in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapur oder Malaysia verlässlichere Partner und häufiger eine «saubere Geschäftsbasis», die globalen Standards entspreche. Das seien dann aber meist keine Jungstars, die an Firmen aus dem Silicon Valley erinnern würden, sondern alteingesessene Familienunternehmen.\nDer E-Fishery-Skandal trifft nicht nur die indonesische Startup-Szene, sondern dämpft die Stimmung in der ganzen Region. Südostasien kämpft derzeit ohnehin mit einer finanziellen Dürre: Im vergangenen Jahr gingen die Zusagen für Venture-Capital gemäss der Fachpublikation «Deal Street Asia» um 42 Prozent zurück und beliefen sich damit noch auf einen Fünftel des Spitzenjahrs 2021.\nDie Fortschrittserzählung in Indonesien ist brüchig geworden. Das Bild eines sprungbereiten Tigerstaats, der in den nächsten 20 Jahren zur viertgrössten Wirtschaftsmacht der Welt aufsteigen könnte, wirkt neuerdings ziemlich realitätsfremd. Die Mittelschicht ist seit 2019 um 10 Millionen Personen geschrumpft und macht laut offiziellen Statistiken heute nur noch 17 Prozent der 277 Millionen Menschen zählenden Bevölkerung aus.\nBesonders unter den Jungen ist die Frustration über mangelnde berufliche Perspektiven gross. Sie entlädt sich in Studentenprotesten unter dem Hashtag «Indonesia Gelap» (schwarzes Indonesien): Die Zukunft des Landes sei schwarz. Viele wandern deshalb in Nachbarstaaten ab, was sich in den sozialen Netzwerken unter dem Hashtag «#KaburAjaDulu» (Nichts wie weg) zeigt. Auch die anhaltende Korruption ist ein Faktor: In entsprechenden Erhebungen bleibt Indonesien schlechter klassiert als konkurrierende Länder wie Malaysia oder Vietnam.\nAuch aus logistischer Sicht ist das Land laut Jörg Wolle immer noch massiv im Hintertreffen. Dass es ferner technologisch im Rückstand ist und zu wenig High-Tech-Investitionen anzieht, zeigt sich daran, dass die Regierung in Jakarta den Apple-Konzern mit dem Verkaufsverbot für das iPhone 16 zwingen will, Milliarden im Land zu investieren."

            "full_content": "Der Financial Times ist aufgefallen, dass es bei Tesla tief in den Geschäftszahlen eine gigantische Diskrepanz zwischen Ausgaben und den Firmenwerten gibt.\n      \n\n      (Bild: Nadezda Murmakova/Shutterstock)\n    \nDer Elektroautokonzern Tesla hat im zweiten Halbjahr 2024 nach eigener Aussage 6,3 Milliarden US-Dollar für den Kauf von Eigentum und Ausrüstung ausgegeben, deren Wert ist in diesem Zeitraum aber nur um 4,9 Milliarden US-Dollar gestiegen. Es fehlen also offenbar 1,4 Milliarden US-Dollar. Das hat die Financial Times bemerkt und meint, dass der Unterschied selbst für einen Konzern wie Tesla enorm sei. Zwar sei es nicht ungewöhnlich, dass beide Werte nicht deckungsgleich sind, aber die Diskrepanz sei auffallend hoch. Was mit dem Geld geschehen ist, ist unklar. Tesla selbst hat sich zu dem Fund nicht geäußert. Noch sei es aber auch nicht unmöglich, dass die fehlenden Sachwerte später in Geschäftszahlen auftauchen.\nAufgefallen ist die Diskrepanz in Statements zum Cashflow, die Tesla bei der US-Börsenaufsicht eingereicht hat. Daraus gehe auch hervor, dass die Anomalie wohl allein auf das vierte Quartal 2024 zurückgeht. Während der Gesamtwert der Güter im Besitz von Tesla im Verhältnis zu Investitionsausgaben vorher zumeist gestiegen ist, gab es plötzlich einen beispiellosen Abfall. Das könne auf unzureichende interne Kontrollen hinweisen, schreibt die Zeitung. Ein zitierter Experte von der SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences verweist derweil auf ähnliche Warnsignale vor Finanzskandalen, darunter den um Wirecard. Die Financial Times findet es noch erwähnenswert, dass Tesla trotz 37 Milliarden US-Dollar Vermögen 6 Milliarden US-Dollar an Schulden aufgenommen hat.\nDer Bericht der britischen Zeitung kommt jetzt zur Unzeit für Tesla. Der Konzern hat mit einem enormen Absatzrückgang zu kämpfen, vor allem in Europa. Das schlägt sich seit Wochen auch an der Börse nieder, wo die Tesla-Aktien seit Jahresbeginn um mehr als 40 Prozent gegenüber dem kurz zuvor erreichten Allzeithoch gefallen sind. Trotzdem ist der Konzern von Elon Musk immer noch deutlich mehr wert als einige der größten Autokonzerne zusammen. Eine Trendwende ist aber auch deshalb unwahrscheinlich, weil Elon Musk offenbar nicht daran denkt, etwas an seiner Rolle als Vertrauter von US-Präsident Donald Trump beim massiven Umbau des US-Staatsapparats zu verändern, obwohl er damit dem Image von Tesla schadet.\n\n    Alles rund ums Auto -   2x pro Woche News und Hintergründe von heise autos\n  \n\n    Ausführliche Informationen zum Versandverfahren und zu Ihren\n    Widerrufsmöglichkeiten erhalten Sie in unserer\n    Datenschutzerklärung.\n  \n\nImmer informiert bleiben: Klicken Sie auf das Plus-Symbol an einem Thema, um diesem zu folgen.

            "full_content": "Трое граждан Болгарии, проживающих в Великобритании, признаны виновными в участии в шпионской операции в Европе в интересах России. Еще трое болгар сознались сами.\nТрое граждан Болгарии, проживающих в Великобритании, признаны виновными в участии в шпионской операции по всей Европе в интересах России. Об этом в пятницу, 7 марта, сообщили в полиции Большого Лондона.\nПосле трехмесячного судебного разбирательства в Центральном уголовном суде Лондона Олд-Бейли две женщины и мужчина были признаны виновными в сговоре \"с целью получения информации, прямо или косвенно полезной для России\", указали там. Речь идет о Катрин Ивановой, Ване Габеровой и Тихомире Иванчеве. Им грозит тюремное заключение сроком до 14 лет.\nЕще трое мужчин - Орлин Русев, Бизер Джамбазов и Иван Стоянов - сами признали себя виновными по обвинению в нарушении Закона о гостайне до начала судебного процесса.\n\"Приговоры вынесены в результате чрезвычайно сложного расследования в отношении группы, которая проводила операции по слежке в Великобритании и Европе от имени российского государства\", - заявил Доминик Мерфи, глава Контртеррористического командования полиции.\nШпионская сеть, по версии следствия, управлялась экс-менеджером фирмыи Wirecard Яном Марсалеком, находящимся в международном розыске и, предположительно, бежавшим в Россию пять лет назад после многомиллиардных махинаций.\nДетективы из Управления по борьбе с терроризмом изучили более 200 000 сообщений и изъяли сотни предметов после скоординированной серии рейдов и арестов, проведенных 8 февраля 2023 года.\nКак выяснило следствие, группа, в частности, вела наблюдение за американским военным объектом в Германии, где могли проходить подготовку украинские солдаты.\nШпионская деятельность, как утверждается, велась в Лондоне, Штутгарте, Вене, Валенсии и Черногории. За это обвиняемые получали значительные суммы денег, заявил прокурор в ходе судебного заседания.\nЯн Марсалек, как предполагается, живет в России под госзащитой, предоставленной Федеральной службой безопасности РФ. Марсалек считается главным подозреваемым в скандале сфирмой Wirecard, где он отвечал за бизнес с так называемыми сторонними компаниями-партнерами - внешними поставщиками платежных услуг, которые обрабатывали или якобы обрабатывали платежи по кредитным картам от имени Wirecard, в основном в Азии.\nВ июне 2020 года выяснилось, что 1,9 млрд евро - предполагаемые доходы от этого бизнеса - \"пропали бесследно\": два банка на Филиппинах, которые, предположительно, держали деньги, сообщили, что у них такой суммы никогда не было. Wirecard, сославшись на \"чрезмерную задолженность\", подала уведомление о банкротстве. Марсалек покинул Германию, когда крах группы стал очевиден.\nСогласно расследованию центра \"Досье\" и газеты Süddeutsche Zeitung, в 2021 году Ян Марсалек получил российский паспорт на подставное имя Германа Баженова. При этом номер выданного ему документа, как выяснили журналисты, совпадает с просроченным паспортом экс-депутата Госдумы РФ Дарьи Митиной и формально может быть недействительным."

            "full_content": "Eine mutmaßliche Agentin Russlands soll laut dem Innenministerium eine Desinformationskampagne in Österreich betrieben haben. \nEs waren unterschiedliche Reaktionen, die am Montag eine Presseaussendung der Direktion Staatsschutz und Nachrichtendienst (DSN) auslösten. Die Behörde verkündete darin, dass sie dank neuer Hinweise „eine umfangreiche russische Desinformationskampagne in Österreich“ aufgedeckt habe. Eine in Wien lebende Bulgarin soll dabei eine maßgebliche Rolle eingenommen habe. DSN-Staatssekretär Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ) warnte in der Aussendung, man dürfe nicht zulassen, dass die „Meinungsbildung in der Politik und in der Öffentlichkeit von außen gesteuert“ würden. Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP) gratulierte Leichtfried „zu diesem wichtigen Erfolg im Kampf gegen Desinformation“. Auch die Neos zeigten sich erfreut.\nAnders klang die Reaktion aus der Staatsanwaltschaft Wien. Deren Sprecherin Nina Bussek erklärte am Montag, die vom Innenministerium nun öffentlich verbreiteten Informationen seien „nichts Neues“. Als man im Dezember über die Verhängung der U-Haft über die Bulgarin entschieden habe, sei „das alles schon bekannt gewesen“, so Bussek.\nFest steht: Die Bulgarin steht seit längerer Zeit im Fokus der DSN. Sie soll Teil eines Spionagerings sein, der Ex-Wirecard-Manager Jan Marsalek zugeordnet wird. Der Österreicher dürfte vor Jahren von russischen Geheimdiensten rekrutiert worden sein. Nach der Insolvenz des Zahlungsdienstleisters Wirecard tauchte er vermutlich in Russland unter. Von dort aus soll er eine von Gruppe Bulgaren, die in London le­ben, auf Geheimdienstoperationen angesetzt haben. Diese flogen im Februar 2023 in London auf, Anfang März 2025 wurden zwei Bulgaren und eine Bulgarin wegen Spionage schuldig gesprochen. Unter anderem sollen sie in Deutschland militärische Einrichtungen ausspioniert haben. Das Strafausmaß wird noch verkündet, den Bulgaren drohen bis zu 14 Jahre Haft.\nBei den britischen Ermittlungen wurden bei den Bulgaren Chats sichergestellt, die einen Seitenstrang nach Österreich offenbarten. Im Sommer 2024 erhielt die DSN dazu Hinweise, offenbar vom britischen Dienst MI5. Die Londoner Spionagezelle soll eine in Wien lebende Bulgarin darauf angesetzt haben, Journalisten und Beamte in Österreich auszuspionieren, unter ihnen Staatsschutz-Chef Omar Hai­ja­wi-Pirch­ner, den in Wien lebenden Enthüllungsjournalisten Christo Grozev und Anna Thalhammer, Ex-„Presse“-Redakteurin und nun­meh­ri­ge „Profil“-Chefin. Ein Ziel sei gewesen, die Handys und Laptops der Zielpersonen zu stehlen und nach Russland zu bringen.\nBeobachtet wurde unter anderem die Wiener Wohnung Grozevs – der Journalist ist für den Kreml ein Feindbild, da er mehrere Operationen der russischen Geheimdienste enthüllt hat. Die Bulgarin soll dabei der Londoner Spionagezelle zugearbeitet haben. Diese hatte Pläne gewälzt, Grozev nach Moskau zu entführen. Erfolgreich war sie dabei nicht, Grozev lebt mittlerweile aus Sicherheitsgründen in einem anderen Land.\nIm Dezember fand bei der Bulgarin in Wien eine Hausdurchsuchung statt, die Frau wurde festgenommen. Die Untersuchungshaft wurde über sie vom Straflandesgericht Wien nicht verhängt. Denn die Beschuldigte spiele eine „untergeordnete Rolle“ und die Tatbegehungsgefahr sei aufgrund der Inhaftierung der Mitbeschuldigten in London „nicht besonders stark ausgeprägt“. Die Frau wurde gegen das Gelöbnis, weder zu fliehen noch die Ermittlungen zu erschweren, enthaftet.\nBei der Hausdurchsuchung im Dezember wurden laut Staatsschutz Datenträger sichergestellt, die nun ausgewertet werden. Neue Hinweise würden zeigen, dass bereits wenige Wochen nach Beginn des russischen Angriffskrieges auf die Ukraine im Februar 2022 „eine für den russischen Geheimdienst arbeitende Zelle tätig geworden“ sei. Diese habe Anfang 2022 eine „breit angelegte Desinformationskampagne in deutschsprachigen Ländern mit Schwerpunkt Österreich“ geplant. Dadurch soll versucht worden sein, die öffentliche Meinung zum Vorteil Russlands zu manipulieren. Die Bulgarin soll dabei laut den Ermittlern eine maßgebliche Rolle gespielt haben.\nWie „Die Presse“ aus Sicherheitskreisen erfuhr, soll die Frau Aufkleber und Graffiti in Wien angebracht haben. So sei unter einem Bild des ukrainischen Präsidenten, Wolodymyr Selenskij, gestanden: „Jeder Schuss ein Russ’.“ Der Spruch stammt aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg, das auch mit diversen rechtsextremen Symbolen gespickte Graffiti sollte nun den Eindruck erwecken, es stamme von nationalistischen und extremistischen Ukrainern. Dadurch sollte Stimmung gegen die Ukraine und für Russland erzeugt werden, heißt es. Weiters soll die Frau auch den Auftrag erhalten haben, im Internet Desinformationskampagnen für Russland in Österreich zu starten. Inwieweit sie diesem Auftrag nachgekommen ist, wird derzeit ermittelt.\nPolitisch schlug die Aussendung hohe Wellen. Die Grünen forderten volle „Aufklärung von Innenminister Gerhard Karner“. Die ÖVP schrieb wiederum in einer Aussendung, Ex-Justizministerin Alma Zadić (Grüne) habe die „Verschleierung im Spionageskandal gefördert“, da während ihrer Amtszeit ein Strafverfahren in einem anderen mutmaßlichen Russland-Spionagefall eingestellt worden sei. Die Staatsanwaltschaft Wien sah in den am Montag bekannt gewordenen Informationen hingegen keinen Neuigkeitswert. Als man im Dezember über die Verhängung der U-Haft über die Bulgarin entschieden habe, sei „das alles schon bekannt“ gewesen, so Sprecherin Bussek."

            "full_content": "Erst vor wenigen Tagen hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Wien ihre Ermittlungen zur Spionageaffäre rund um den ehemaligen Verfassungsschützer Egisto Ott fertiggestellt. Montagfrüh teilte die Direktion für Staatsschutz und Nachrichtendienst (DSN) mit, eine „umfangreiche Desinformationskampagne in Österreich“ aufgedeckt zu haben. Die Staatsanwaltschaft betonte allerdings später, diese Informationen seien „nichts Neues“.\n         \nIm Mittelpunkt steht eine im Dezember verhaftete Bulgarin, die für Russland spioniert haben soll und laut DSN geständig ist. Die Spionagecausa rund um die Bulgarin ist Teil eines Komplexes an Ermittlungen und Verdachtslagen rund um mutmaßliche Spionage für Russland. Diese soll federführend von Ex-Wirecard-Manager Jan Marsalek – er soll nach Russland geflüchtet sein – organisiert worden sein.\nEhemalige BVT-Mitarbeiter – neben Egisto Ott auch der damalige Abteilungsleiter Martin Weiss – stehen jedenfalls im Verdacht, sensible Daten an Marsalek weitergereicht zu haben. Zuletzt waren in London mehrere bulgarische Staatsbürger wegen Spionage verurteilt worden. Laut Gericht wurden sie von Marsalek angeheuert. Laut DSN hatte die in Wien tätige Bulgarin Kontakt zur Londoner Zelle.\nDie in Österreich Ende letzten Jahres verhaftete Bulgarin – sie befindet sich auf freiem Fuß – war laut DSN maßgeblich in eine von Russland gesteuerte Desinformationsoperation verwickelt. Zweck dieser verdeckten Kampagne sei es gewesen, die öffentliche und politische Meinung zum Nachteil der Ukraine und Vorteil Russlands zu manipulieren, teilte die DSN Montagfrüh in einer Aussendung mit.\nDie DSN sei durch die Auswertung von Datenträgern, die bei einer Hausdurchsuchung bei der verdächtigen Bulgarin im Zuge ihrer Verhaftung im Dezember vergangenen Jahres vollzogen worden war, auf „diese nachrichtendienstliche Operation“ draufgekommen, hieß es weiter. Laut Medienberichten waren unter anderem DSN-Chef Omar Haijawi-Pirchner selbst, weitere DSN-Mitarbeiter, der bulgarische Investigativjournalist Christo Grosew und die „Profil“-Chefredakteurin Anna Thalhammer von der Bulgarin überwacht worden.\nDie Sprecherin der Staatsanwaltschaft Wien, Nina Bussek, erklärte am Montag allerdings, dass die vom Innenministerium nun öffentlich verbreiteten Informationen „nichts Neues“ seien. Bei der Entscheidung über die Haftfrage im Dezember sei „das alles schon bekannt“ gewesen, betonte sie. Die Ermittlungen gegen die Bulgarin gingen weiter.\nDie DSN hatte zuvor betont, die Ermittlungen hätten ergeben, dass bereits wenige Wochen nach Beginn des russischen Angriffskrieges auf die Ukraine im Februar 2022 „eine für den russischen Geheimdienst arbeitende Zelle tätig geworden war. Diese plante Anfang 2022 eine breit angelegte Desinformationskampagne in deutschsprachigen Ländern mit Schwerpunkt Österreich.“\nDas Ziel dieser Zelle sei gewesen, durch gezielte Aktionen die öffentliche Meinung negativ gegen die Ukraine sowie Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj zu beeinflussen und somit eine prorussische Stimmung zu generieren, erklärte das Innenministerium weiter.\nDie Personen seien sowohl „in der medialen Landschaft im Internet“ als auch mit Offlineaktionen, etwa mittels Aufklebern und Graffiti, aktiv geworden. Dabei sollte der Anschein erzeugt werden, die Akteure seien proukrainische Aktivisten. Dafür wurde laut DSN insbesondere rechtsextreme Symbolik verwendet. Ziel war es demnach – ganz entsprechend der vielfach von Kreml-Chef Wladimir Putin geäußerten Unterstellung –, die Ukraine als rechtsextrem und nationalistisch zu verunglimpfen.\nDie Verdächtige ist geständig, insbesondere im Jahr 2022 für die Zelle tätig gewesen zu sein, so das Ministerium.\nDie Auswertung der bei der Bulgarin sichergestellten Datenträger habe anhand von Chatnachrichten die detaillierten Planungen der von Russland gesteuerten Zelle offengelegt. Die Verdächtige dürfte darin eine erhebliche Rolle gespielt haben. Sie diente laut derzeit vorliegenden Erkenntnissen als nachrichtendienstliche Kontaktperson. Russische Nachrichtendienste dürften sie weiters mit der Verteilung von Inhalten in Deutschland und Österreich beauftragt haben.\nDie Tatverdächtige dokumentierte erfolgte Aktionen. Diese Dokumentationen wurden auch an Mittäterinnen und Mittäter, die in Russland sowie in Großbritannien aufhältig waren, übermittelt. Zuletzt waren in einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden. Sie handelten mutmaßlich im Auftrag von Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Marsalek.\nErfreut reagierte Innenminister Gerhard Karner (ÖVP). Er gratulierte via Instagram „zu diesem wichtigen Erfolg im Kampf gegen Desinformation“.\n„Die Verbreitung von falschen Narrativen, Fake News und manipulativen Inhalten untergräbt das Vertrauen in unsere Institutionen und gefährdet den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt“, reagierte der zuständige Staatssekretär Jörg Leichtfried (SPÖ). „Wir Österreicherinnen und Österreicher bilden uns unsere Meinung lieber selbst“, so Leichtfried, der zugleich eine Stärkung der DSN forderte.\nAuch NEOS zeigte sich erfreut, dass „eine umfangreiche russische Desinformationskampagne gegen Österreich (…) aufgedeckt“ worden sei. Der Europaabgeordnete Helmut Brandstätter verwies in dem Zusammenhang auch auf die FPÖ: „Trollfabriken produzieren diese Lügen, die FPÖ und die von ihr finanzierten Medien verbreiten sie munter weiter“, betonte er.\nSeit letzter Woche liegt im Justizministerium der Vorhabensbericht der Staatsanwaltschaft Wien rund um mutmaßliche Spionage des Ex-Verfassungsschützers Ott zur Entscheidung, ob Anklage erhoben wird. Gegen Ott wird seit 2017 wegen Amtsmissbrauchs, geheimen Nachrichtendiensts zum Nachteil Österreichs und weiterer Delikte ermittelt. Am 29. März 2024 wurde er deshalb fest- und bis zum 26. Juni desselben Jahres in U-Haft genommen.\nOtt musste sich erst kürzlich vor Gericht verantworten, wurde aber freigesprochen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft legte dagegen Rechtsmittel ein. Ihm war vorgeworfen worden, dem ehemaligen FPÖ-Nationalratsabgeordneten Hans-Jörg Jenewein Informationen über ein Treffen des sogenannten Berner Clubs beschafft und ihm eine Liste mit Namen von BVT-Beamten übermittelt zu haben. Man habe nicht feststellen können, ob diese Infos tatsächlich aus internen Quellen gestammt hätten, lautete die Urteilsbegründung. Der Prozess bildete aber quasi nur eine Art Nebenstrang zu anderen Vorwürfen gegen den Ex-BVT-Beamten.\nred, ORF.at/Agenturen"

            "full_content": "Гражданка Болгарии подозревается в Австрии в активном распространении ложной информации, направленной на создание пророссийских и антиукраинских настроений в обществе.\nВласти Австрии сообщили о раскрытии масштабной российской кампании по дезинформации. Расследование ведется в отношении гражданки Болгарии, подозреваемой в шпионаже и активном распространении целенаправленной ложной информации, сообщило в понедельник, 24 марта, Управление государственной безопасности и разведки (DSN) в Вене.\nПо данным австрийской спецслужбы, с помощью данной кампании преступная группа пыталась повлиять на общественное мнение в Австрии, склоняя его в пользу России и против Украины и ее президента Владимира Зеленского и формируя пророссийские настроения. Подозреваемая призналась в работе на ячейку, в особенности, в 2022 году.\n\"Распространение ложных нарративов, фейковых новостей и манипулятивного контента подрывает доверие к нашим институтам и ставит под угрозу сплоченность общества\", - заявил государственный секретарь МВД Австрии Йорг Ляйхтфрид, комментируя выводы следствия. Он напомнил, что с помощью дезинформации можно повлиять на выборы, способствовать политической нестабильности и поставить под угрозу демократическое общество в целом.\nАвстрийское информагентство APA указало, что подозреваемая в настоящее время находится на свободе. Кроме того, женщина подтвердила, что у нее есть связи с предполагаемой ячейкой, которая действует в Великобритании по поручению бывшего члена совета директоров Wirecard Яна Марсалека, находящегося в международном розыске и, предположительно, бежавшего в Россию несколько лет назад после многомиллиардных махинаций, пишет далее агентство, ссылаясь на представителя Ляйхтфрида.\nПреступная группа активизировала свои действия спустя несколько недель после начала полномасштабного российского вторжения в Украину, о чем свидетельствуют данные на носителях информации, изъятых в ходе обысков, отмечается далее. В начале 2022 года члены ячейки спланировали масштабную кампанию по дезинформации в немецкоязычных странах с основным акцентом на Австрию.\nВ рамках кампании использовались как онлайн-, так и офлайн-методы, в частности, наклейки и граффити, оформление которых должно было создать впечатление, что их авторами являются проукраинские активисты. Однако в содержательном плане злоумышленники прибегали к решениям, которые были отвергнуты широкой общественностью, в частности, они использовали правоэкстремистскую и националистскую символику и лозунги.\nМежду тем, в начале марта суд в Лондоне признал проживающих в королевстве трех граждан Болгарии виновными в участии в шпионской операции по всей Европе в интересах России. Катрин Иванова, Ваня Габерова и Тихомир Иванчев вступили в сговор \"с целью получения информации, прямо или косвенно полезной для России\", им грозит тюремное заключение сроком до 14 лет.\nШпионская сеть, по версии следствия, управлялась экс-менеджером Wirecard Яном Марсалеком. \"Приговоры вынесены в результате чрезвычайно сложного расследования в отношении группы, которая проводила операции по слежке в Великобритании и Европе от имени российского государства\", - заявил глава Контртеррористического командования полиции Доминик Мерфи. Еще трое мужчин сами признали себя виновными до начала судебного процесса. Шпионская деятельность, как утверждается, велась в Лондоне, Штутгарте, Вене, Валенсии и Черногории.\nЯн Марсалек, как сообщают СМИ, живет в России под госзащитой и получил паспорт гражданина РФ. Он является главным подозреваемым в скандале с фирмой Wirecard, где он отвечал за бизнес с внешними поставщиками платежных услуг, которые обрабатывали или якобы обрабатывали платежи по кредитным картам от имени Wirecard, в основном в Азии. В 2020 году выяснилось, что 1,9 млрд евро - предполагаемые доходы от этого бизнеса - \"пропали бесследно\": два банка на Филиппинах, которые, предположительно, держали деньги, сообщили, что у них такой суммы никогда не было. Wirecard подала уведомление о банкротстве, Марсалек покинул Германию."

Flugblätter sorgen zudem für Unruhe. In Jerusalem geht die Polizei gegen Proteste vor.\nNach dem Ende der Waffenruhe geht Israels Offensive im Gazastreifen weiter voran: Israelische Bodentruppen sind nun bis ins Zentrum und den Norden des Küstenstreifens vorgerückt. Die zentrale Salah-ad-Din-Straße zwischen dem Norden und dem Süden des Gebietes sei im sogenannten Netzarim-Korridor gesperrt, teilte Armeesprecher Avichay Adraee am Donnerstag mit. Der Netzarim-Korridor trennte bis zur Waffenruhe Nord- von Südgaza, im Zuge des Geisel-Waffenstillstandsabkommens konnten die Menschen ihn unter Aufsicht von arabischen und US-Sicherheitskräften wieder passieren. Nun ist nur noch die an der Küste verlaufende Straße für die Passage von Nord nach Süd geöffnet.\nQuelle: taz\ndazu auch: Die Gesetzlosen\nWas die Wiederaufnahme der israelischen Angriffe in Gaza mit Netanjahus Machterhalt zu tun hat.\nIn der Nacht vom 17. auf den 18. März startete die israelische Regierung erneut massive Angriffe auf Gaza mit bislang fast 500 Toten und hunderten Verletzten. Dieser faktischen Beerdigung der ohnehin auf tönernen Füßen stehenden Waffenruhe waren wochenlange Sabotageversuche der Regierung Netanjahu vorausgegangen. Bereits kurz nach ihrem Inkrafttreten am 19. Januar verletzte Israel in mehrfacher Hinsicht die Vereinbarung. In der durch flächendeckende Zerstörung von Wohnhäusern entstandenen Massenobdachlosigkeit in Gaza gehörten mitten im Winter Zelte und Container als Notunterkünfte zu den dringend benötigten Hilfsgütern. Nur ein Bruchteil der vereinbarten Menge an Zelten wurde allerdings von der israelischen Armee nach Gaza gelassen, von den Containern kein einziger. Vom vereinbarten Treibstoff – in Gaza dringend für den Betrieb von Maschinen zur Beseitigung von Trümmern und zur Stromerzeugung in Gesundheitseinrichtungen benötigt – kam nur etwa ein Drittel an.\nQuelle: medico\nund: Israel kümmert sich nicht um die Gefangenen.

Eine Überprüfung der Zweitstimmen in den Bundesländern brachte erstaunliche Differenzen zutage. […]\nZum Vergleich: Die Volkspartei SPD hat nach der Prüfung nur 840 Zweitstimmen mehr erhalten. Was aber ist die Ursache für die ungewöhnlich hohe Zahl an “aufgefunden” Stimmen für das BSW?\nLaut “wahlrecht.de” soll es jedenfalls nichts mit der fehlerhaften Übertragung von Zahlen von den Gemeinden und Kommunen an die Bundeswahlleiterin am Wahlabend zu tun haben, wie in sozialen Medien bereits behauptet worden war. Vielmehr geht “wahlrecht.de” davon aus, dass die auffällig hohe Zahl an Zweitstimmen zugunsten des BSW mit der Position der Partei auf den Wahlzetteln zu tun haben könnte.\nQuelle: t-online\ndazu auch: Erfolglose Anträge zum Wahlergebnis des BSW\nMit Beschlüssen vom heutigen Tag hat der Zweite Senat des Bundesverfassungsgerichts mehrere Anträge abgelehnt, die letztlich darauf zielen, eine Neuauszählung der abgegebenen Stimmen zum 21. Deutschen Bundestag wegen vermeintlicher Auszählungsfehler noch vor der Feststellung des endgültigen Wahlergebnisses zu erreichen\nQuelle: Bundesverfassungsgericht\n\ndazu auch: Kriegskredite als Konjunkturprogramm\nDie bevorstehende Entscheidung im Bundestag über Grundgesetzänderungen für eine gigantische Aufrüstung und die militärische Ertüchtigung der Infrastruktur, ist eine Entscheidung über Krieg und Frieden in Europa.\nDas Kriegsfieber steigt in Deutschland und Europa. Union und SPD, im Grundsatz unterstützt von den Grünen, wollen die Schuldenbremse per Grundgesetzänderung lösen, um eine gigantische Aufrüstung voranzutreiben. Im Vorgriff auf den nächsten NATO-Gipfel im Juni 2025 in Den Haag, soll die Möglichkeit geschaffen werden, über massive Kreditaufnahmen das zu erwartende Rüstungsziel von 3,5 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts – für Deutschland eine Steigerung der jährlichen Militärausgaben von rund 90 Milliarden Euro auf 150 Milliarden Euro – zu erreichen.\nQuelle: Sevim Dagdelen auf Overton Magazin\nund: Juncker und andere Stimmen gegen den Rüstungswahn\nGanz EUropa spricht von Aufrüstung und Krieg. Ganz EUropa? Nein, es gibt noch ein paar abweichende Stimmen – etwa der frühere Kommissionspräsident Juncker.\n“Ich fühle mich mit der Aufrüstungsrhetorik nicht wohl”, sagte Juncker dem “Luxemburger Wort”. Die EU müsse aufpassen, dass sie sich nicht selbst in einen Krieg hineinrede. Zuvor hatte Juncker erklärt, dass die Ukraine nicht reif für einen EU-Beitritt sei, auch nicht für die Nato.\nÄhnliche Töne kommen vom scheidenden SPD-Fraktionschef Mützenich in der “Berliner Zeitung”. Er kritisiert den rein militärischen Ansatz der Europäer in der Ukraine: Man müsse „über den Tellerrand der gegenwärtigen Debatte hinausdenken“.\nQuelle: Lost in Europe\n\ndazu auch: Auch Dagdelen klagt gegen Sondersitzungen im Bundestag\nMehrere AfD-Politiker, ihre Fraktion sowie die der Linken gehen bereits gerichtlich gegen die Sondersitzungen für das geplante Sondervermögen vor. Jetzt zieht das BSW nach. Sie fürchten riesige Zinsen und eine zu kurze Bedenkzeit für das Vorhaben.\nAuch die BSW-Abgeordnete Sevim Dagdelen will mit einem Eilantrag beim Bundesverfassungsgericht die Verabschiedung des Milliardenpakets für Verteidigung und Infrastruktur stoppen. “In der Kürze der Zeit lässt sich eine ordentliche Gesetzesberatung mit seriöser Folgenabschätzung nicht vornehmen”, sagte Dagdelen.\nIhr Rechtsvertreter Christoph Degenhart argumentiert in dem Eilantrag an Karlsruhe, die Abgeordnete des Bündnisses Sahra Wagenknecht sei wegen der kurzfristigen Anberaumung der Beratungen über das Gesetz zur Änderung des Grundgesetzes in ihren Rechten verletzt. Ziel des Antrags beim Verfassungsgericht ist es, das Gesetzgebungsverfahren von der Tagesordnung des Bundestags zu nehmen.\nQuelle 1: n-tv\nQuelle 2: Antrag [PDF]\n\ndazu: Jeffrey Sachs: Europa sollte direkten Dialog mit Russland führen\nJeffrey Sachs, Professor an der Columbia University, hat kürzlich in einer Rede vor dem Europäischen Parlament Europa mangelnde Unabhängigkeit im russisch-ukrainischen Konflikt vorgeworfen. Europa sei zu abhängig von den USA und habe keine aktive Vermittlerrolle gespielt.\nSachs sagte, Europa hätte den russisch-ukrainischen Konflikt verhindern können, wenn es eine vernünftige Politik betrieben hätte. Europa sollte eine eigene Außenpolitik haben, nicht nur eine russophobe.\nQuelle: CRI online\nAnmerkung Christian Reimann: Bitte lesen/sehen Sie dazu auch Die Geopolitik des Friedens.\ndazu auch: Putin begrüßt Waffenruhe-Vorschlag unter Bedingungen – Trump nennt Erklärung „vielversprechend“\nRussland ist nach den Worten von Kremlchef Putin prinzipiell mit dem US-Vorstoß für eine 30-tägige Waffenruhe einverstanden. Sie müsse aber zu einem dauerhaften Frieden führen. Er forderte zudem, sich mit den „grundlegenden Ursachen des Konfliktes“ zu befassen. Und dankte US-Präsident Trump.\nQuelle: Welt Online\nAnmerkung unserer Leserin S.B.: So viel dazu, dass Putin überhaupt nicht verhandeln will. Der Hoffnungsschimmer wird größer, dass dieser Krieg zu einem Ende kommt. Und die EU sitzt noch nicht einmal am Katzentisch mit dabei. \n\nAnmerkung unserer Leserin S.B.: Völlig unreflektierte Selbstbeweihräucherung scheint bei den Grünen gang und gäbe zu sein. Aber immerhin hat sie sich während ihrer Zeit als Ministerin eine Altersvorsorge von 4.950 Euro verdient – dazu kommt noch das aus der Abgeordnetentätigkeit. Danke für nichts!\n\ndazu auch: Ursprung des Coronavirus Merkel bestreitet Vertuschung von BND-Bericht\nDer BND soll es bereits 2020 für wahrscheinlich gehalten haben, dass das Coronavirus einem Laborunfall in China entstammte.

            "full_content": "Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder.\nThe Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin.\nBut as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him.\nHe thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording.\nThat morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance.\nAs the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian – Katrin Ivanova – sent a message on Telegram.\nHer partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin.\nAnother woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route.\nWaiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes.\nOperational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty.\n\"We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,\" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.\n\"It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers.\"\nWatching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47.\nAn associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent.\nHe moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence – the interception of communications or electronic signals.\nWhen police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, \"a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance\".\nThey might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth £175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop.\nAmong the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek.\nRoussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company.\nThen, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times,  the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of £20 billion at its peak, was intact.\nNow, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse.\nTogether, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia.\nLinked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK.\nThe group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.\nAlongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed \"The Destroyer\" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.\nA neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's \"enormous calves\".\nBut they were not ineffective – Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police.\nThe group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his \"friends in Russia\". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his \"minions\", Dzhambazov chief among them.\n\"There are no bosses here,\" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev.\nNonetheless, \"minion\" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone.\nThe group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022.\nBut it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023.\nBetween August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app.\nThey reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years – four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime.\nAs well as Dobrokhotov, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door.\nHe was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins.\nA thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state.\nGaberova was instructed to befriend him.\nIn Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as \"Red Sparrow\".\nMarsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat – a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow.\nA former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home.\nIvan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate.\nWhen confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen.\nProsecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev \"is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations\".\nIndeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services \"uncover\" the \"activists\" responsible.\nIn February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled.\nTheir offers to help were rebuffed.\nFewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders.\nLater that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers – sophisticated communications interception equipment – could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his \"Indiana Jones garage\", where it was \"gathering dust\".\nMarsalek returned to the idea repeatedly.\nBy February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and \"one more person\" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems.\nHad they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield – leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences.\n\"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,\" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.\nBefore their plans could be put into action, they were arrested – Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.\nThough Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.\nIn his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused.\nNone of the six denied their actions.\nRoussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia.\nIvanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents.\nThey could face up to 14 years in prison. They will be sentenced in May.\nBut it is not the end.\n\"If there is no regime change, there will be new and new teams of people who come to kill or kidnap you,\" Roman Dobrokhotov told the BBC.\n\"This is this actually something that motivates us to work.\n\"From the very beginning, I was sure it was something directly controlled by Vladimir Putin.\n\"In his dictatorship you would never take responsibility on your own to do such political stuff. \n\"You'd always have a direct order from the president.\n\"Putin is a psychopath who has no borders,\" he said.\nMessage extracts have been edited for brevity.\nA rare photo album of Churchill’s cousin, Clare Sheridan, reveals her secret trip to Soviet Russia.\nThe agreement comes after days of talks with the US in Saudi Arabia.\nThe two sides struck separate deals with the US after three days of talks in Saudi Arabia.\nRussia hits northern Ukraine as its negotiators meet US officials in Riyadh to discuss a ceasefire.\nHow are Russia and Ukraine placed after three years of fighting and with Donald Trump suggesting talks on ending the war could begin soon?\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Das genaue Strafmaß steht noch nicht fest.\nIn einem spektakulären Fall der Spionage für Russland sind in London zwei Frauen und ein Mann aus Bulgarien schuldig gesprochen worden. Sie handelten mutmaßlich im Auftrag von Ex-Wirecard-Vorstand Jan Marsalek, wie die Nachrichtenagentur PA meldete. Ihnen drohen Haftstrafen von bis zu 14 Jahren. Das Strafmaß soll noch verkündet werden.\nMarsalek habe demnach als Vermittler zwischen dem russischen Geheimdienst und dem Anführer des Spionagerings gehandelt. Der Ex-Wirecard-Vertriebsvorstand ist seit der Pleite des ehemaligen Dax-Konzerns untergetaucht und wird in Russland vermutet. In dem Londoner Prozess war Marsalek nicht selbst angeklagt.\nDie Angeklagten im Alter von 33, 30 und 39 Jahren wurden der Spionage, die Leben und die nationale Sicherheit gefährde, schuldig gesprochen. Es sollen Personen und Orte ausgespäht worden sein, die für Russland interessant sind. In Deutschland seien das etwa eine Luftwaffenbasis sowie eine nicht näher genannte Botschaft gewesen.\nDie Spionageaktivitäten sollen in London sowie in Stuttgart, Wien, Valencia und dem Balkanstaat Montenegro stattgefunden haben. Dafür hätten die Angeklagten beträchtliche Geldsummen erhalten, hatte die Staatsanwältin im Verlauf des Prozesses gesagt. Zwei weitere Bulgaren hatte sich der Spionage schuldig bekannt, gegen sie war es nicht mehr zum Prozess gekommen.\nEin Axel Springer Unternehmen\nDie WELT als ePaper: Die vollständige Ausgabe steht Ihnen bereits am Vorabend zur Verfügung – so sind Sie immer hochaktuell informiert.

            "full_content": "Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as \"one of the largest\" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. \nVanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023.\nWhile the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps.\nThe methods they used were the sort of thing you would \"expect to see in a spy novel\", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy.\nGaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents.\nThey were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. \nHere police found a \"treasure trove\" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment.\nThey also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his \"minions\", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise.\nRoussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial.\nThe cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.\nAs part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as \"hooked and in love\" with her in WhatsApp messages.\nAnother operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022.\nDuring the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was \"sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information\".\nThe police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity.\nMet counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an \"extremely sophisticated\" operation that \"posed a threat to national security and individuals\".\nRoussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard. \nThe Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an \"intermediary for the Russian intelligence services\".\nRoussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations.\nRoussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm. \nStoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname \"The Destroyer\".\nDzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on \"British values\".\nBut Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past.\nDuring their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia.\nIvanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5.\nThe prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies:\nThis targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev.\nMarsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria.\nThe spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him.\nThis targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national.\nThe cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat.\nAt one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone.\nThis targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard.\nMr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum.\nThere is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard.\nProsecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance.\nThis involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022.\nThe court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a \"fake protest\" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia.\nThis involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022.\nThis is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.\nProsecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base.\nJurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur.\nHe is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a \"foreign agent\" by Russia in November 2023.\nA rare photo album of Churchill’s cousin, Clare Sheridan, reveals her secret trip to Soviet Russia.\nThe agreement comes after days of talks with the US in Saudi Arabia.\nThe two sides struck separate deals with the US after three days of talks in Saudi Arabia.\nThrigby Hall Wildlife Gardens says Kubu came to Great Yarmouth in 2013 when he was two years old.\nRussia hits northern Ukraine as its negotiators meet US officials in Riyadh to discuss a ceasefire.\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

            "full_content": "Austriacki kontrwywiad rozbił grupę pracującą na rzecz rosyjskich służb specjalnych. Zajmowała się ona szpiegostwem i dezinformacją. Kierująca pracami siatki wywiadowczej Bułgarka przyznała się do postawionych jej zarzutów.\nAustriacka Dyrekcja Ochrony Państwa i Wywiadu (DNS) poinformowała w poniedziałek o zatrzymaniu i postawieniu zarzutów obywatelce Bułgarii, która jest podejrzana o szpiegowanie na rzecz Rosji oraz prowadzenie szeroko zakrojonej kampanii dezinformacyjnej na terytorium Austrii. Jak podała służba prasowa DNS, celem tej tajnej akcji było manipulowanie austriacką opinią publiczną i polityczną na szkodę Ukrainy i korzyść Rosji.\nSiatka została zdemaskowana dzięki analizie nośników danych, przeprowadzonej w grudniu ubiegłego roku podczas przeszukania domu podejrzanej Bułgarki. Śledztwo wykazało, że zaledwie kilka tygodni po rozpoczęciu przez Rosję agresji na pełną skalę przeciwko Ukrainę w lutym 2022 r. \"komórka pracująca dla rosyjskich służb specjalnych stała się aktywna. Komórka ta zaplanowała szeroko zakrojoną kampanię dezinformacyjną w krajach niemieckojęzycznych, ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem Austrii\" – czytamy w komunikacie DNS.\nCelem tej kampanii było nastawienie opinii publicznej przeciwko Ukrainie i jej prezydentowi Wołodymyrowi Zełenskiemu. Próbowano osiągnąć to zarówno poprzez działalność w internecie, jak i w przestrzeni publicznej, na przykład przez wykonywanie graffiti bądź rozmieszczanie naklejek (wlepek), których treść i oprawa wizualna miała na celu stworzenie wrażenia, że ich autorami i pomysłodawcami byli proukraińscy aktywiści. Chodziło przede wszystkim o grafiki sugerujące powiązania ukraińskiej armii z ideologią nazistowską i faszystowską.\nNa urządzeniach należących do podejrzanej Bułgarki odnaleziono też szczegółowy plan działania kontrolowanej przez Rosjan komórki, który był oparty na wiadomościach czatowych (przesyłanych za pośrednictwem różnych komunikatorów). Śledczy są przekonani, że podejrzana odgrywała w akcji bardzo istotną rolę, bowiem według aktualnych informacji pełniła ona funkcję osoby kontaktowej rosyjskiego wywiadu. Sama zatrzymana przyznała się do pracy na rzecz Rosjan.\nDo informacji odniósł się sekretarz stanu w austriackim ministerstwie spraw wewnętrznych Joerg Leichtfried: \"Rozprzestrzenianie fałszywych narracji, nieprawdziwych wiadomości i manipulacyjnych treści podważa zaufanie do naszych instytucji i zagraża spójności społecznej\" – powiedział. Wyraził też przekonanie, że rozprzestrzenianie dezinformacji może wpływać na wybory, zwiększać niestabilność polityczną i zagrażać demokratycznemu społeczeństwu.\n\"Nie możemy pozwolić, aby kształtowanie się opinii politycznej i publicznej było kontrolowane z zewnątrz. My, Austriacy, wolimy kształtować własne opinie sami\" – podsumował Leichtfried.\nŚlady działalności rozbitej komórki prowadzą do podejrzewanego o szpiegostwo byłego menedżera firmy Wirecard Jana Marsalka. Ten rodowity Austriak po ucieczce do Rosji kierował grupą bułgarskich agentów, którzy prowadzili operacje szpiegowskie na terenie całej Europy. Kilku członków tej siatki, w tym jej lider, zostało schwytanych w Wielkiej Brytanii w 2023 roku. Wszyscy oni zostali skazani za szpiegostwo. Niektórzy przyznali się do winy, inni zostali uznani za winnych w toku procesu.

            "full_content": "Dan McCrum hat schon viele Wirtschaftskrimis ausgelÃ¶st. Zu den wichtigsten EnthÃ¼llungen des \"Financial Times\"-Journalisten gehÃ¶rt zum Beispiel der Wirecard-Skandal. McCrum gilt als maÃgeblich dafÃ¼r, dass Wirecard gestÃ¼rzt ist. Und insofern ist es fÃ¼r Unternehmen in der Regel kein gutes Zeichen, wenn McCrum Ã¼ber sie berichtet. FÃ¼r Autobauer Tesla und dessen Chef Elon Musk kÃ¶nnte nun Ãhnliches gelten. Ihm widmete der Zahlenspezialist McCrum nÃ¤mlich seinen neuesten Scoop in der \"FT\". Dort beschreibt er, dass in der Tesla-Bilanz offenbar 1,4 Mrd. US-Dollar fehlen â und wirft auÃerdem die Frage auf, warum sich Tesla so viel Geld leiht, obwohl eigentlich genÃ¼gend Cash vorhanden ist.\nDie LÃ¼cke von 1,4 Mrd. Dollar identifiziert McCrum bei den Investitionen des Autobauers. Demnach habe das Unternehmen im dritten und vierten Quartal 2024 6,3 Mrd. Dollar in Sachanlagen investiert. So weit, so normal â abzulesen im Income Statement von Tesla. Weiter unten jedoch, in der Bilanz, wo VermÃ¶gen und Verbindlichkeiten des Unternehmens aufgelistet sind, werden allerdings nur 4,9 Mrd. Dollar beim entsprechenden Unterpunkt \"Property. Plant and Equipment\" aufgefÃ¼hrt. Wo also ist die Differenz von 1,4 Mrd. Dollar, fragt sich McCrum.\nEinen (Teil-)Grund dafÃ¼r liefert er gleich mit. Gewisse Differenzen seien nicht ungewÃ¶hnlich und ergeben sich hÃ¤ufig aus Wechselkurseffekten, Abschreibungen und TransaktionsgebÃ¼hren. Doch 1,4 Mrd. Euro, also mehr als 20 Prozent der Gesamtinvestitionen? Das sei hÃ¶chst ungewÃ¶hnlich. Zumal 80 Prozent von Teslas VermÃ¶genswerten in den USA liegen. Auch Abschreibungen kÃ¤men hierfÃ¼r kaum infrage, denn die Unterschiede zwischen Investitionen und deren entsprechender Bewertung in der Bilanz schwanken fÃ¼r gewÃ¶hnlich deutlich geringer bei Tesla. Falls es hier einen Sondereffekt gegeben habe, hÃ¤tte man dies normalerweise in die FuÃnoten geschrieben. Dort steht allerdings nichts. Auf eine Anfrage der FT antwortete Tesla nicht.\nUnd noch etwas sei komisch, schreibt der FT-Journalist. Angeblich verfÃ¼ge Tesla Ã¼ber Barmittel von 37 Mrd. Dollar. Gleichzeitig habe man aber 6 Mrd. Dollar an Krediten aufgenommen. Ein gewisser Teil an Fremdkapitalfinanzierung ist selbst bei solchen BarvermÃ¶gen normal, aber 6 Mrd. Dollar, was gerade einmal 16 Prozent der Barmittel entspricht, sei eine \"red flag\", schreibt McCrum.\nWas nun passiert, ist ungewiss. Investoren werden wohl sehr genau auf die nÃ¤chste Quartalsbilanz von Tesla schauen, die am 23. April erwartet werden. Es ist mÃ¶glich, dass die VermÃ¶genswerte hier wieder auftauchen, schreibt auch McCrum. Aber wenn nicht, dÃ¼rften WirtschaftsprÃ¼fer und BehÃ¶rden enorm wachsam werden. Das sinkende Anlegervertrauen dÃ¼rfte dann wohl das kleinste Problem fÃ¼r Chef Elon Musk werden.Â \nCapital ist eine Partnermarke des stern.

            "full_content": "Tempo, Atmosphäre, Klarheit: Die deutsch-dänische Serie „Die Affäre Cum-Ex“ brilliert mit ihren Schauspielern und Dialogen. Sie zeigt, wie schwer der Steuerskandal war.\nWie lassen sich die komplexen Zusammenhänge des größten internationalen Steuerbetrugs aller Zeiten einem Fernsehpublikum vermitteln? Man kann linear erzählen, Ermittler wie Zuschauer im Unklaren über die kriminellen Hintermänner lassen und auf den Knalleffekt am Ende setzen. Drehbuchautor Jan Schomburg hat sich in der deutsch-dänischen Koproduktion „Die Affäre Cum-Ex“, die vor wenigen Wochen auf der Berlinale Premiere feierte, dagegen entschieden. Er setzt in den acht Teilen seiner Serie auf Tempo, Atmosphäre und vor allem Klarheit.\nKeine vier Minuten sind in der Pilotfolge vergangen, da ist man mittendrin: Der renommierte Steueranwalt Bernd Hausner, auf dessen Rat die Wirtschaftsbosse und Spitzenpolitiker des Landes ehrfürchtig hören, erläutert den anderen Anwälten seiner Kanzlei seinen neuesten Plan: Bei Aktiengeschäften mit und ohne Dividendenanspruch mit Hilfe von sogenannten Leerverkäufern eine nur einmal gezahlte Kapitalertragsteuer gleich mehrfach vom Finanzamt zurückerstatten lassen – eine risikolose Investition mit hoher Rendite. Um seine hoffnungslos überforderten Kollegen zu beruhigen, bemüht Hausner das Bild von der Leergutrücknahme im Supermarkt: Wie von Zauberhand würden dort aus einer Pfandflasche für einen Moment zwei und damit käme mehr Geld aus der Supermarktkasse. „Der Supermarkt ist in Wirklichkeit der Staat. Und wir wollen nicht behaupten, dass wir Mitleid mit dem Staat hätten.“\nWeil Hausner selbst einmal Finanzbeamter war, sind die Verhältnisse zwischen Gut und Böse schnell geklärt. Zugleich ist der Bezug zur Realität hergestellt: Jahrelang haben Banken, Aktienhändler, Fonds und Investoren mit der Cum-Ex-Masche verschiedene europäische Staaten ausgeplündert, beraten und gedeckt von Anwälten. Nach einer Analyse der Transaktionsdaten dieser Geschäfte durch den Mannheimer Finanzwissenschaftler Christoph Spengel beläuft sich der Steuerausfall in Deutschland auf mindestens 7,2 Milliarden Euro. In Dänemark, wo der zweite Handlungsstrang der Serie spielt, waren es umgerechnet zwei Milliarden Euro: Den Gesamtschaden für Europa beziffern die Macher der Serie auf 146 Milliarden Euro.\nIn der Darstellung seiner Figuren und der Handlung bezieht sich Schomburg auf Recherchen deutscher und dänischer Investigativjournalisten, allen voran Oliver Schröm (mittlerweile Autor beim „Stern“), der zur Aufklärung des Skandals zahlreiche TV- und Printbeiträge beigetragen und zwei viel beachtete Bücher geschrieben hat. Dass die Serie dennoch kein Dokumentarfilm mit Spielfilmelementen und gar nicht so leicht konsumierbar ist wie etwa die Netflix-Produktion „King of Stonks“ aus dem Jahr 2022, die vom Milliardenbetrug bei Wirecard inspiriert wurde, hat mehrere Gründe.\n Externer Inhalt von Youtube\n Um externe Inhalte anzuzeigen, ist Ihre widerrufliche Zustimmung nötig.

Jede Episode beleuchtet sowohl das Geschehen in Deutschland als auch in Dänemark, setzt auf Zeitsprünge und Verknappung, was angesichts eines Handlungsbogens von 2005 bis 2023 auch notwendig ist. Hierzulande folgen wir dem rasanten Erfolg Hausners und seines jungen Adlatus Sven Lebert sowie ihrer persönlichen Beziehung – die im echten Leben dem mehrfach verurteilten Cum-Ex-Strippenzieher Hanno Berger und seinem Ex-Geschäftspartner Kai-Uwe Steck entspricht. Die dritte Hauptfigur, die ehrgeizige Staatsanwältin Lena Birkwald, wird erst gen Mitte der Serie eingeführt; sie ist unverkennbar der ehemaligen Kölner Chefermittlerin Anne Brorhilker nachempfunden.\nIn Dänemark hingegen steht die starke Frau gleich von Beginn an im Mittelpunkt. Sie legt sich mit den Banken und einem passiven Behördenleiter an: Die Finanzbeamtin Inger Brøgger kämpft in der Zoll- und Steuerbehörde Skat einen aussichtslosen Kampf gegen Lobbyisten, die sie daran hindern, den Steuerbetrug aufzuklären. Als sich für die idealistische Brøgger endlich eine Tür öffnet, endet dies in einer persönlichen Tragödie und Verrat.\nMit nüchternen Bildern und ruhigen Sequenzen schafft der dänische Erzählstrang eine gute Balance zum bildgewaltigeren Hase-und-Igel-Spiel, das Hausner, Lebert und ihre Verfolgerin Birkwald aufführen. Die Überzeichnung ihrer Charaktere – verschwenderischer Luxus auf Seiten der skrupellosen Anwälte und eine burschikose Staatsanwältin in Funktionskleidung, die in ihrer Freizeit ehrenamtlich Vogelbestände zählt – ist gewünscht und funktioniert durch die Liebe zum Detail. Die Figuren gewinnen an Tiefe, was sich besonders in Leberts Konflikt mit seinem Elternhaus und der Ablösung Leberts von seinem Ziehvater Hausner zeigt.\nDass die Stereotypen nicht langweilen, liegt maßgeblich an der bis in die Nebenrollen starken Besetzung. Nils Strunk verkörpert den Wandel Leberts vom schüchternen Nachwuchsanwalt zum kühl taktierenden Opportunisten hervorragend. Die Besetzung des Altmeisters Hausner mit Justus von Dohnányi ist ein Glücksgriff: Sein Spiel von Arroganz, überhöhter Moral und Wutausbrüchen lässt eine Vorstellung von jenem Elfenbeinturm entstehen, in dem so mancher Cum-Ex-Profiteur noch heute sitzt.\nLisa Wagner wiederum profitiert in der Rolle der Staatsanwältin Birkwald von ihrer Vorerfahrung im Bereich der Krimiserien. Sie verleiht der Figur der Anklägerin eine Schroffheit, die es sogar mit dem damaligen Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz wegen dessen möglicher Einflussnahme auf die Hamburger Finanzbehörde aufnehmen kann – im Übrigen das einzige Mal, dass die Serie ihren fiktionalen Rahmen verlässt. Aber auch Lena Birkwald muss Rückschläge einstecken. Ihre Durchsuchungen im Umfeld der Hamburger SPD und in der Finanzbehörde werden unterbunden. Die streitbare Staatsanwältin droht den Rückhalt ihrer Behörde zu verlieren. Auch ihre Bemühungen, Hausner aus der Schweiz ausliefern zu lassen, scheitern bei einem Besuch in Zürich.\nIm Moment der Niederlage kommt es beim Finale in Zürich zu einer ersten persönlichen Begegnung der Antagonisten. Sie wirkt wie eine Hommage an die berühmte Dinnerszene aus Michael Manns „Heat“, in der sich Al Pacino und Robert de Niro als Jäger und Gejagter gegenübersitzen: Birkwald und Hausner, den seine Flucht in die Schweiz vor den Ermittlern schützt, belauern sich auf neutralen Boden bei Trüffelpasta und Weißwein. Im Gespräch muss der Cum-Ex-Strippenzieher eingestehen, dass ihn all die Millionen seine persönliche Freiheit gekostet haben. Als auch sein letzter Trumpf nicht sticht und Birkwald ihm erklärt, „die Welt zu einem besseren Ort“ machen zu wollen, indem sie ihn und seine Spießgesellen seiner gerechten Strafe zuführt, gibt sich Hausner geschlagen – wortlos verlässt er das Restaurant.\nKurz darauf wird Hausner doch an Deutschland ausgeliefert. Ihm wird der Prozess gemacht. Doch Birkwald hat schon die nächsten Täter im Visier. Selbst das zögerliche Dänemark lässt nun Aktienhändler verhaften. Wie eine Fabel sendet das äußerst unterhaltsame Format damit auf seinen letzten Metern doch eine klare moralische Botschaft: Wer die Gesellschaft vorsätzlich verrät, den holt dieser Verrat bald ein.\nRedakteur in der Wirtschaft.\n Die ehemalige Staatsanwältin Anne Brorhilker fordert an der Universität Frankfurt mehr Aktivität im Kampf gegen Wirtschaftskriminalität. Bisher schaut der Staat dem Verbrechen fast ohnmächtig zu.\n Was ist heute noch Identität? Helene Hegemanns neuer Roman folgt einer jungen Profikämpferin beim Driften durch die Großstadt, wo auch Sex keinen Ausweg aus der Einsamkeit mehr garantiert.\n Über die Ausreden der ewig Schuldlosen: Eric Ambler erzählt in seinem 1938 veröffentlichten Roman „Anlass zur Unruhe“ über ein Jahrzehnt, das erschreckend dem unseren gleicht."

            "full_content": "O a doua operaţiune de spionaj a Kremlinului vizând disidenţi ruşi a fost descoperită în Marea Britanie. Dezvăluirea vine de la The Observer, după arestarea, săptămâna aceasta, a unor cetățeni bulgari din rețeaua fugarului Jan Marsalek, condamnați pentru spionaj în favoarea Kremlinului, scrie News.ro. \nRoman Dobrohotov, un jurnalist aflat în vizorul celor şase bulgari condamnaţi pentru spionaj în favoarea Rusiei, a declarat că a fost informat despre noi tentative de supraveghere a familiei sale. Jurnalistul rus de investigaţii Roman Dobrohotov a fugit din Rusia în 2021 şi de atunci se teme pentru viaţa sa. Dobrohotov este redactorul-şef al site-ului Insider, a cărui activitate de investigaţie a dus la aplicarea de sancţiuni economice de către Occident pentru aproximativ 80 de companii şi 60 de persoane din cauza rolului lor în facilitarea războiului lui Vladimir Putin în Ucraina.\n„Am primit un avertisment de la poliţie primăvara trecută”, a declarat Dobrohotov, care are 41 de ani şi care s-a mutat în Marea Britanie în ianuarie 2023. „Aceste încercări sunt în curs de desfăşurare”, a menţionat el..\nDetaliile avertismentului dat lui Dobrohotov nu sunt dezvăluite la cererea acestuia, precizează The Observer. La fel, nu este precizat nici unde locuieşte împreună cu soţia sa, Katia, şi cu cei doi fii ai lor, în vârstă de 8 şi 10 ani.\nŞase cetăţeni bulgari cu statut de rezident în Regatul Unit - Vania Gaberova, 30 de ani, Katrin Ivanova, 33 de ani, Tihomir Ivancev, 39 de ani, Orlin Roussev, 47 de ani, Biser Djambazov, 43 de ani, şi Ivan Stoianov, 34 de ani - au fost condamnaţi în Marea Britanie - trei dintre ei chiar săptămâna aceasta - pentru efectuarea de operaţiuni de spionaj în ţară şi în străinătate.\nJan Marsalek, 44 de ani, un cetăţean austriac despre care se crede că este agent rus, a condus de la Moscova operaţiunea de spionaj din Marea Britanie. El este căutat internaţional pentru o presupusă fraudă de 1,9 miliarde de euro la compania financiară germană Wirecard, aflată în faliment.\nDouă dintre ţintele reţelei lui Jan Marsalek au fost jurnaliştii Hristo Grozev şi Roman Dobrohotov, care i-au demascat pe cei doi ofiţeri ai serviciilor militare de informaţii ale Rusiei care au încercat să îi ucidă pe Serghei Skripal şi pe fiica sa, Iulia, în Salisbury în 2018.\nMesaje descoperite de poliţie arată că Dobrohotov a fost urmărit atât de îndeaproape, încât codul PIN al iPhone-ului său a fost preluat de unul dintre spionii care stăteau lângă el într-un avion.\nAu existat, de asemenea, discuţii în cadrul grupului cu privire la otrăvirea lui Dobrohotov cu ricin pe străzile din Londra sau răpirea acestuia cu ajutorul unei ambarcaţiuni mici.\nAvertismentul poliţiei cu privire la o nouă încercare de a-l viza pe Dobrohotov a venit la câteva luni după arestarea reţelei de spioni, în februarie 2024.\n„Am înţeles că, după arestarea bulgarilor, trebuie să existe în continuare o atenţie continuă faţă de mine şi Hristo, deoarece nu ne-am oprit activitatea. De asemenea, sursa noastră ne-a spus că, după ce această echipă controlată de FSB (serviciul de securitate al Rusiei) a fost arestată, sarcina - aceeaşi sarcină - este acum încredinţată GRU (serviciile militare de informaţii). Ne aşteptam ca aşa ceva să continue. Deci, după ce poliţia a spus că ştie despre noi tentative, nu a fost foarte surprinzător, ci doar o confirmare a ceea ce ne spunea şi sursa noastră rusă”, a declarat Dobrohotov.\nJurnalistul a mărturisit că trebuie să fie în continuă mişcare pentru a încerca să se sustragă atenţiei Kremlinului.\n„Toată familia mea este îngrijorată, desigur. Îşi fac griji pentru mine şi înţeleg că nu sunt în siguranţă - dacă pun noviciok (agentul biologic folosit în tentativa de asasinat asupra lui Skripal) pe mânerul uşii, toţi pot suferi. Pe de altă parte, cea mai urâtă situaţie este când nu ştii dacă ar trebui să fii foarte îngrijorat sau dacă te poţi relaxa. Întotdeauna te îndoieşti, dacă eşti paranoic, cu privire la toate aceste lucruri. Deci, într-un fel, este bine să ştii că eşti la curent cu această situaţie”, a explicat Dobrohotov.\n„Poliţia antiteroristă lucrează îndeaproape cu forţele de poliţie, cu partenerii şi comunităţile pentru a identifica orice activitate represivă a statelor străine în Regatul Unit şi va încerca să întrerupă această activitate acolo unde este posibil. S-a dovedit a fi fost cazul într-o serie de arestări recente şi acuzaţii care au fost făcute în legătură cu infracţiuni în temeiul Legii privind securitatea naţională”, a precizat un purtător de cuvânt al poliţiei antiteroriste britanice. \n„Încurajăm membrii publicului să raporteze orice acuzaţii de interferenţă străină către forţele de poliţie locale. La primirea unor astfel de rapoarte, ofiţerii vor evalua dacă există preocupări sau probleme de protecţie sau de securitate şi, în colaborare cu ofiţerii specializaţi, vor fi în măsură să ofere persoanelor afectate consiliere şi sprijin adecvat în materie de siguranţă şi securitate, după caz. Şedinţele de informare privind siguranţa personală nu reprezintă limita activităţii noastre de a menţine oamenii în siguranţă, însă acestea creează legături directe între persoane, organizaţii şi poliţie. Importanţa acestor sfaturi nu ar trebui să fie subestimată şi nici amploarea activităţii operaţionale care are loc în cadrul echipelor noastre de investigaţii proactive şi cu agenţiile partenere pentru a menţine siguranţa oamenilor”, a transmis poliţia.\nUrmărește știrile Digi24.ro și pe Google News"

Bei den Ermittlungen um seinen Tod ging es auch um Firmenanteile in Milliardenhöhe.\n21.03.2025, 14:34 Uhr\nSieben Jahre nach dem mysteriösen Verschwinden des Tengelmann-Chefs Karl-Erivan Haub gibt es neue Spekulationen über sein Schicksal. Und sie klingen wie ein Hollywood-Thriller. Der Unternehmer wurde zuletzt am 7. April 2018 von einer Überwachungskamera im Skigebiet am Klein Matterhorn erfasst, bevor sich seine Spur verlor. \nTrotz einer der aufwendigsten Suchaktionen in der Geschichte der Schweizer Bergrettung wurde seine Leiche nie gefunden. 2021 erklärte ihn das Amtsgericht Köln offiziell für tot. Doch nun hat das „Manager Magazin“ erstmals Bilder veröffentlicht, die Haub im selben Jahr in Moskau zeigen sollen.\nDabei teilte dessen Familie im April 2021 mit, keine Hoffnung mehr zu haben, ihn noch lebend zu finden. Bereits 2020 beantragten Haubs Brüder beim Amtsgericht Köln eine Todeserklärung. Dadurch wurde ein Zerwürfnis zwischen den Brüdern und Haubs Ehefrau öffentlich bekannt: Letztere wollte eine Todeserklärung zunächst vermeiden, um nicht mit ihren Kindern aus dem Gesellschafterkreis des Familienunternehmens ausscheiden zu müssen.\nNach der erfolgten Erklärung wurde Christian Haub neuer Tengelmann-Chef. 2021 einigte er sich mit dem Rest der Familie auf einen Deal, der eine Zahlung von 1,7 Milliarden Euro an die Familie des Verschollenen vorsah. Allerdings hatten diejenigen, die an der These eines Skiunfalls zweifelten, zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits Privatermittler eingeschaltet, um nach Haub zu fahnden.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\n An dieser Stelle finden Sie einen von unseren Redakteuren ausgewählten, externen Inhalt, der den Artikel für Sie mit zusätzlichen Informationen anreichert.

Zwei Fotos von Überwachungskameras sollen ihn fast drei Jahre nach seinem Verschwinden in zwei verschiedenen Vororten in Moskau zeigen. Die Fotos hatte der israelisch-amerikanische Sicherheitsdienstleister Interfor beschafft – wie genau, bleibt unklar.\nDie Aufnahmen sind nicht von sonderlich hoher Qualität, zudem fehlen offenbar die Rohdaten der Fotos, anhand derer sich Ort und Zeitpunkt verifizieren ließen. Dennoch beziffern zwei vom Unternehmen beauftragte Expertengutachten die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass es sich bei der fotografierten Person tatsächlich um Haub handelt, mit 99 beziehungsweise 85 Prozent.\nDie nun erstmals veröffentlichten Fotos liegen seit einiger Zeit auch der zuständigen Staatsanwaltschaft vor. Diese ermittelt nun gegen den Bruder Christian Haub – der das Unternehmen übernahm – wegen Verdachts auf eine falsche eidesstattliche Versicherung. Dieser hatte nämlich 2021 versichert, „keine belastbaren Hinweise, geschweige denn Beweise“ dafür zu haben, dass sein Bruder noch leben könnte – allerdings kannte er zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits die Fotos der Privatdetektive.\n © picture alliance / Roland Weihra/Roland Weihrauch \nInzwischen räumt er dies auch ein, lässt aber über seinen Anwalt erklären, dass „die Fotos entweder manipuliert wurden oder eine andere Person zeigen“. Mehr noch, der Anwalt argumentiert, dass sein Mandant gar kein Interesse an einer Todeserklärung gehabt habe, da dessen Firmenanteile deshalb für Hunderte Millionen gekauft werden mussten – anstatt sie einfach einzuziehen.\nWürde Christian Haub dennoch verurteilt, drohten ihm bis zu drei Jahre Haft und Tengelmann die nächste Führungskrise. Der Einzelhandelskonzern aus dem 19. Jahrhundert ist heute ein Imperium mit 60.000 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern und rund 8,5 Milliarden Euro Umsatz, zu dem auch die Baumarktkette Obi und der Textildiscounter Kik gehören.\nWarum aber sollte Karl-Erivan Haub seinen eigenen Tod vorgetäuscht und in Moskau untergetaucht sein? Eine enge Verbindung zu dem Land hatte er in jedem Fall. Mindestens seit 2010 unterhielt er zahlreiche geschäftliche Kontakte nach Russland und war immer wieder dort. \nEr plante, mit seiner Unternehmensgruppe in den russischen Markt einzusteigen. 150 Filialen seiner Discountermarke sollten dort eröffnet werden, Grundstücke waren bereits gekauft, doch eine Eröffnung erfolgte nie. Dennoch sollen viele Millionen Euro aus dem Unternehmen in zweifelhaften Kanälen in Russland versickert sein.Dabei soll Haub auch enge Kontakte zu mehreren umstrittenen russischen Oligarchen gehabt haben. Zudem gibt es Gerüchte über eine Liebesaffäre mit einer russischen Eventmanagerin, mit der er in den Tagen vor seinem Verschwinden mehrfach telefonierte. Selbst über eine Tätigkeit für den russischen Geheimdienst wird spekuliert. Der bestens vernetzte Tengelmann-Tycoon besaß neben der deutschen offenbar auch die US-amerikanische und russische Staatsbürgerschaft.\nBeweise für diese Gerüchte gibt es nicht. Dennoch werden die nun auch an die Öffentlichkeit gelangten Fotos die Debatte um das Schicksal des CEOs wieder anfachen. Doch die Aufnahmen allein haben wohl keine ausreichende Beweiskraft, und zu viele Fragen sind noch offen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft teilt daher mit, bislang „keinen Anlass“ zur Revision der Todeserklärung zu sehen.\nDie neueste Wendung im Fall erinnert dennoch an den des früheren Wirecard-Vorstands Jan Marsalek. Dieser tauchte unter, nachdem bekannt wurde, dass Milliardenbeträge in den Bilanzen des Unternehmens fehlten. Nach internationalen Fahndungen wurde er zuletzt in Russland vermutet, wo er mutmaßlich unter dem Schutz russischer Geheimdienste stehen soll. (Trf)\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster"

Seit Beginn des von Kremlchef Wladimir Putin befohlenen Angriffskriegs auf die Ukraine sind die Beziehungen zwischen Russland und Großbritannien zusätzlich angespannt. Anfang Februar erreichte der Streit mit der Eröffnung eines Strafverfahrens eine neue Eskalationsstufe.

Februar gegen die Bank Obotritia, die zum Portfolio des Investors Rolf Elgeti gehört, schon ein Veräußerungs- und Zahlungsverbot (Moratorium) erlassen und dies mit Insolvenzgefahr begründet. Für die Kunden, insbesondere 1300 Sparer, beginnt nun eine Zeit des Wartens auf ihr Geld. Diese Phase soll nicht lange dauern.\nZumindest einen Teil ihrer Gelder sollen die Kunden schnell zurückbekommen. Da Obotritia nach Ansicht der Finanzaufsicht Bafin nicht mehr in der Lage ist, die Einlagen – die Rede ist von rund 40 Millionen Euro, die teilweise von der Spar-Plattform Raisin vermittelt wurden - zurückzuzahlen, hat die Behörde den sogenannten „Entschädigungsfall“ festgestellt. Das bedeutet, dass die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung einspringt und nun die Ansprüche prüft. Je Kunde sind im Regelfall höchstens 100.000 Euro Rückzahlung möglich, in Ausnahmefällen auch mehr. Der Bundesverband der privaten Banken erklärte, dass die Entschädigungseineinrichtung der deutschen Banken (EdB) sich „umgehend und unaufgefordert“ mit den Einlegern in Verbindung setzen werde.\nObotritia war jedoch nicht Mitglied des Bankenverbands und daher auch nicht an dessen freiwilligen Einlagensicherungsfonds beteiligt, der die gesetzliche EdB erweitert. Geschützt sind Sicht-, Termin- und Spareinlagen. „Verbindlichkeiten, über die eine Bank Inhaberschuldscheine ausgestellt hat, wie zum Beispiel Inhaberschuldverschreibungen und Zertifikate, werden hingegen nicht geschützt“, teilte die EdB mit.\nDie Bankhaus Obotritia GmbH war nach einem Beschluss des Hauptgesellschafters, Elgetis Obotritia KGaA, schon seit Oktober 2024 in Liquidation, die Bafin hatte den Insolvenzantrag in der vergangenen Woche gestellt. Die Bank hatte erst 2019 die Geschäfte aufgenommen und war laut Bafin hauptsächlich im Bereich Gewerbeimmobilien tätig - ein Sektor, der im Zuge der Corona-Pandemie in die Krise rutschte. Über die Kreditplattform Creditshelf vergab Obotritia zeitweise auch Darlehen an kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen. Das Geschäftsmodell habe sich als nicht nachhaltig erwiesen, befand die Bafin schon Ende Februar. Die Bilanzsumme der Bank betrug zuletzt knapp 52 Millionen Euro. Damit sei Obotritia zu klein, um eine Bedrohung für die Finanzstabilität darzustellen, beruhigte die Finanzaufsicht.\nRedakteur in der Wirtschaft.\n Die Nord LB ist nach fünf Jahren Sanierung wieder dividendenfähig. Vorstandschef Frischholz nennt das ein „tolles Problem“ und steckt höhere Renditeziele.\n Der hohe Goldpreis ist fast ein Indikator für eine Welt in Unordnung. Auf einem Treffen diskutiert die Edelmetallbranche auch, wie es mit Amerikas Goldvorräten unter Donald Trump weitergeht.\n US-Notenbankchef Jerome Powell spricht von „transitorischer Inflation“ als möglicher Folge der Politik Donald Trumps. Das weckt unschöne Erinnerungen."

            "full_content": "In today’s global digital economy, payment processing systems are essential for businesses to accept and manage transactions efficiently. However, some industries face significantly higher risks due to complex regulatory environments, data sensitivity, and\r\n greater vulnerability to fraud and chargebacks. This category is known as \r\nhigh-risk payment processing.\nHigh-risk payment processing is critical in sectors such as finance,\r\nhealthcare, and manufacturing, where companies frequently handle large transaction volumes, international payments, and sensitive data. Without effective risk management strategies, businesses may face financial losses, reputational\r\n damage, and legal consequences.\nThis paper explores the core challenges in high-risk payment processing, the methodologies used to mitigate these risks, and the role of emerging technologies in transforming secure payment practices. Through real-world case studies and forward-looking insights,\r\n this research highlights best practices that organizations can adopt to enhance their payment processing capabilities.\nHigh-risk payment processing refers to managing transactions for businesses that operate in industries with heightened risks of fraud, chargebacks, or regulatory scrutiny. Payment processors categorize businesses as high-risk based on factors such as:\nSeveral industries are frequently classified as high-risk due to their unique financial, operational, and regulatory challenges:\nSeveral factors amplify risks in payment processing:\nEffective risk management starts with structured frameworks to assess vulnerabilities and mitigate threats.

As cyber threats evolve and digital payment systems grow in complexity, businesses must adopt a layered approach\r\n to mitigate risks effectively. By leveraging AI, blockchain, and secure payment frameworks, organizations can minimize fraud exposure, improve customer trust, and maintain compliance in high-risk environments.\nFor organizations seeking to enhance their high-risk payment processing capabilities, investing in security innovations, employee education, and specialized partnerships will be crucial for sustained success.\nThis content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra.

            "full_content": "Dan McCrum es un nombre conocido en el periodismo financiero europeo: el periodista financiero del Financial Times fue el primero en detectar que la firma alemana Wirecard había gastado grandes cantidades de dinero en comprar empresas que no existían. El Estado alemán le investigó durante años, acusándole de intentar manipular el mercado contando bulos sobre Wirecard, hasta que un día descubrieron que tenía razón y que la compañía financiera llevaba años falsificando sus cuentas. La empresa quebró en 2020 con un agujero contable de más de 2.000 millones. Pues bien: cinco años después de la investigación que le hizo saltar a la fama en el mundo financiero, McCrum acaba de alertar de un descuadre de 1.400 millones en las cuentas de Tesla.\nEn un artículo en el Financial Times, el periodista advierte de que ha estado revisando las cuentas de Tesla, y los números no salen. La compañía de Elon Musk invirtió 6.300 millones de dólares netos en \"compras de propiedad y equipamientos\" en el segundo semestre de 2024, pero el valor acumulado de sus propiedades y equipamientos solo creció en 4.900 millones.\nEl problema es que esos dos números deberían cuadrar. El ejemplo que pone es que, mirando a uno de sus rivales, en las cuentas de General Motors el dinero gastado en inversiones en propiedades sí aparece también recogido en un aumento idéntico del valor total de sus propiedades. Es simple lógica contable: si una firma compra un edificio por un millón, el valor total de sus edificios debería aumentar en ese mismo millón.\nLa pregunta que se hace McCrum es: ¿a dónde han ido a parar los 1.400 millones de diferencia? Las posibles explicaciones son que no esté reflejadas todas las operaciones de venta, que haya habido alguna fusión o adquisición, o que las divisas extranjeras hayan descuadrado las cifras en dólares por variaciones en el tipo de cambio. Pero las propias cuentas de Tesla se molestan en rechazar esas posibilidades: los números son netos y sí incluyen todas las compras y ventas, no ha habido fusiones en este tiempo, y las divisas difícilmente pueden provocar ese descuadre cuando el 80% de sus activos están en EEUU. Y, como apunta, en los últimos años nunca ha habido una diferencia tan amplia en sus cifras.\nOtra de sus preocupaciones es por qué Tesla necesita emitir tanta deuda cuando, según sus cuentas, está nadando en dinero en efectivo. La firma tiene 36.000 millones de dólares en efectivo y añadió 2.000 millones más el último trimestre, según sus cuentas. Pero también emitió 3.900 millones de dólares en bonos para financiarse, algo que no tendría demasiado sentido si tiene tanto dinero acumulando polvo en su caja fuerte. Por comparar, en ese tiempo, otra compañía con grandes cantidades de efectivo en sus cuentas como es Apple aprovechó esa liquidez para reducir sus deudas en 30.000 millones\nEl periodista concluye que todas estas señales pueden no significar nada: quizá el agujero en sus activos se rellenará el próximo trimestre, y quizá la firma necesite dinero a corto plazo para cubrir necesidades de gasto especiales este primer trimestre y prefiera emitir deuda rápida antes que echar mano de sus 'ahorros'. Pero, advierte, todas estas anomalías son \"banderas rojas\" que alertan de que los controles internos pueden ser más débiles de lo ideal. En el peor de los casos podría ser hasta una estratagema para hinchar artificialmente sus ingresos.\nPor el momento, es demasiado pronto para saber si este humo apunta a un fuego, o si es solo parte de la niebla que ha descendido sobre Tesla desde que Donald Trump llegó a la Casa Blanca y Musk se convirtió en el centro de todos los focos con su plan para desmontar la Administración de EEUU. Esta mañana, Ross Gerber, cofundador y CEO de Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, aseguró que Musk tiene que elegir entre su cargo en el Gobierno de Trump o la dirección de Tesla, porque está descuidando a la firma automovilística. Una opinión similar a la de Dan Ives, analista de Wedbush, que dijo la semana pasada que Musk estaba demasiado distraído para enfrentar al reto creciente de la competencia china.\nA estas alturas, la mayor esperanza de Tesla, y en la que está invirtiendo enormes cantidades de dinero, es la IA. Para numerosos analistas, esta posibilidad de futuro es la que justifica las disparadas valoraciones de la compañía. Musk quiere que la firma deje de ser una automovilística y se centre en el software y la IA. Pero este tipo de dudas no ayudan."

            "full_content": "7 марта жюри присяжных в центральном уголовном суде Лондона — Олд-Бейли — признало виновными в шпионаже в пользу России трех граждан Болгарии. Еще трое участников предполагаемой преступной сети также ожидают вердикта. Издание The Insider, слежкой за журналистами которого — Христо Грозевым и Романом Доброхотовым — занимались подсудимые, подробно исследовало фабулу дела (о некоторых его деталях было известно и ранее). «Медуза» пересказывает главные эпизоды из материала.\nК организации операции по слежке за Христо Грозевым российские спецслужбы приступили 14 декабря 2020 года — в день, когда The Insider совместно с проектом Bellingcat опубликовали расследование об отравлении Алексея Навального, назвав имена причастных к преступлению сотрудников Федеральной службы безопасности РФ и Центра специальных технологий (НИИ-2). По данным источника The Insider в российских спецслужбах, соответствующее распоряжение поступило лично от Владимира Путина.\nВечером того же дня бывший операционный директор финансового стартапа Wirecard Ян Марсалек, которого The Insider считает агентом Управления собственной безопасности ФСБ, написал сообщение давнему знакомому — болгарину Орлину Русеву (именно переписки фигурантов дела легли в основу нынешнего расследования). Тот специализировался на IT и помогал организовывать слежку за людьми, которые предположительно представляли интерес для российских спецслужб. На этот раз Марсалек попросил о сборе всей возможной информации о Грозеве.\nТу же задачу он поставил перед другим своим партнером — бывшим офицером австрийской спецслужбы BVT Мартином Вайсом. В переписке уже со своим подчиненным Эгисто Оттом Вайс назвал Грозева «бывшим агентом ЦРУ», который «теперь работает фрилансером». The Insider предполагает, что изначальной задачей операции был именно поиск следов ЦРУ, поскольку несколько дней спустя, 17 декабря, сам Путин назвал расследование отравления Навального «легализацией материалов американских спецслужб».\nВ конце января 2021 года Христо Грозев и Роман Доброхотов, который на тот момент еще жил в Москве, стали официальными объектами слежки ФСБ. В конце марта, когда Доброхотов возвращался в Россию из командировки за рубежом, его задержали в аэропорту Шереметьево под предлогом «опроса о ситуации с коронавирусом в Европе». На время беседы с сотрудниками ФСБ у журналиста изъяли два телефона и ноутбук. Позднее независимая проверка установила, что гаджеты пытались безуспешно взломать. А в корпус ноутбука был вставлен трекер, отслеживающий передвижения.\nПристальная слежка за Грозевым — одновременно группами Орлина Русева и Эгисто Отта — началась в апреле 2021-го. В июле в переписке с Русевым Марсалек утверждал, что обсуждается также вариант похищения журналиста и его вывоза в Москву. Тогда же сообщник предполагаемого агента российских спецслужб сообщал, что его группа ведет наблюдение за Грозевым неподалеку от Бургаса, где тот находился на отдыхе.\nСпустя несколько дней навестить коллегу в Болгарии должен был и Доброхотов, но его планам помешал обыск, который 28 июля устроили в его квартире сотрудники ФСБ (под предлогом расследования дела о клевете). Журналиста не арестовали — и через два дня ему удалось перейти российско-украинскую границу через лес.\nТем временем слежка за Грозевым в Болгарии не приносила успехов. Группа Русева то теряла его из виду, то шла по ложному следу — например, следила за домом, который ошибочно приняла за недвижимость журналиста, хотя он всего лишь снимал там комнату на короткий срок через платформу Airbnb.\nВ августе Доброхотов и Грозев встретились в украинских Карпатах. При этом, по данным источника The Insider в СБУ, одна из местных криминальных группировок также получила «заказ» из Москвы на похищение и вывоз Доброхотова в РФ. Этому плану тоже не суждено было сбыться: уже в конце месяца журналист перебрался в Вену, где поселился недалеко от Грозева. При этом за квартирой последнего уже вели наблюдение люди Марсалека и Русева. По данным The Insider, в группу входили по меньшей мере пять граждан Болгарии: 43-летний медицинский курьер Бисер Джамбазов, его 33-летняя подруга Катрин Иванова, работавшая ассистентом в медицинской лаборатории, 39-летний декоратор Тихомир Иванчев, его бывшая девушка 30-летняя косметолог Ваня Габерова, а также 32-летний бывший боец ММА Иван Стоянов. Поскольку никто из перечисленных не был профессиональным работником спецслужб, слежка по-прежнему не была эффективной.\nПри этом наблюдали за Грозевым не только в Австрии. В сентябре 2021-го несколько участников группы полетели одним рейсом с журналистом в Валенсию на встречу коллектива Bellingcat (благодаря доступу к системе «Амадеус» — оператору крупнейшей в мире системы по бронированию билетов, — доступ к которой им продал сотрудник Swissport), остановились в той же гостинице и слали Марсалеку фото объекта слежки. А чуть позднее Катрин Иванова также сопровождала Доброхотова. Журналист летел из Будапешта в Берлин, и подчиненная Марсалека сидела на соседнем сидении и записывала видео на скрытую камеру. В столице Германии Доброхотов скрылся из виду Ивановой.\nВ июне 2022-го слежка принесла первый «материальный» результат: во время конференции премии «Редколлегия» в Черногории из номера Грозева был похищен мобильный телефон, однако никаких данных на устройстве не хранилось. В том же месяце из квартиры журналиста в Вене украли ноутбук. По версии Грозева, в руки российских спецслужб попало старое устройство его покойной матери, на котором также не было никаких чувствительных данных.\nВ августе того же года Марсалек и Русев начинают обсуждать в переписке новую операцию — похищение Доброхотова. На тот момент журналист уже жил в Великобритании. Марсалек и Русев планировали похитить его на лодке и передать в руки российских спецслужб в международных водах. Альтернативным сценарием было убийство Доброхотова. Русев предлагал организовать «несчастный случай в душе», но Марсалек выступал за более жестокую расправу: «Может быть, сжечь его заживо на улице — опрыскать какой-нибудь сверхсильной кислотой, VX, как северокорейцы! Или рицином».\nУже к середине месяца Марсалек сообщил сообщнику, что идею похищения российские спецслужбы не согласовали, посчитав ее слишком рискованной. Русев в переписке при этом настаивал на том, что, по его мнению, «более „эффективным“ и сильным посланием было бы убийство» Доброхотова, по примеру расправ советских агентов над Степаном Бандерой и Львом Троцким. Марсалек на это отвечал: «Я согласен. Хотя ледоруб — это оружие вчерашнего дня. Лучше кувалда, в стиле [ЧВК] Вагнера. Я передам это выше».\nВ январе 2023-го всю команду Русева, включая его самого, арестовали в Великобритании.\nПодпишитесь на SOS-рассылку «Медузы».

Nu se știe unde se află Jan Marsalek în prezent, însă se crede că este în Rusia, de unde ar fi condus rețeaua de spionaj.\nFinancial Times relata într-un material din aprilie 2024 că Marsalek s-ar fi folosit de funcționari compromiși din serviciile secrete austriece pentru a spiona cetățeni europeni, inclusiv prin baza de date Schengen, și pentru a plănui spargeri și asasinate comise de echipe rusești de elită.\nIvanova, Gaberova și Ivancev au pledat nevinovați pentru acuzația de conspirație cu scopul de a aduna informații utile inamicului, susținând că nu știau că ajută Rusia. Totuși, instanța i-a condamnat, iar Ivanova a fost găsită vinovată și pentru deținere de documente de identitate false.\nToți sunt cetățeni bulgari cu statut de rezidenți în UE după ce au locuit în Regatul Unit timp de mai mulți ani, scrie Sky News.\nBBC precizează că principalele ținte ale celulei au fost jurnaliștii de investigație Hristo Grozev și Roman Dobrohotov, a căror activitate include dezvăluirea rolului Rusiei în atacurile cu agenți neurotoxici asupra liderului opoziției ruse Aleksei Navalnîi în 2020 și a lui Serghei Skripal în Salisbury în 2018.\n Editor :  Marina Constantinoiu  \nUrmărește știrile Digi24.ro și pe Google News"

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\nLONDON (Reuters) -     Three Bulgarians were found guilty in a London court on Friday of being part of a Russian spy unit run by Wirecard fugitive Jan Marsalek to carry out surveillance for the Kremlin on a U.S. military base and individuals targeted by Moscow.\nKatrin Ivanova, 43, Vanya Gaberova, 30, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were convicted at London's Old Bailey court, charged with conspiracy to gather information useful to an enemy between August 2020 and February 2023, which they denied.\nProsecutors said the trio – along with Orlin Roussev, 47, and Bizer Dzhambazov, 43, who had admitted being part of the conspiracy before the trial started – carried out surveillance on journalists and planned to stage a fake protest outside the Kazakh embassy in London.\nMarsalek also tasked the team of Bulgarian nationals to spy on Ukrainian soldiers being trained at the U.S. base in Germany, with a view to tracking their movements on the battlefield after Russia's 2022 invasion, prosecutors said.\nThe Austrian national is wanted by German authorities as the former chief operating officer of collapsed payments company Wirecard, accused of a multi-billion euro fraud.\nMarsalek's current whereabouts are unknown, but he is believed to be in Russia.\nIvanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev all pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to gather information useful to an enemy, saying they did not know they were helping Russia.\nBut they were convicted, and Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing false identity documents.\nThey will be sentenced in May but the judge Nicholas Hilliard warned them that they faced jail terms.\nThere was no immediate response to the convictions from the Russian embassy in London.\n (Reporting by Michael Holden and Sam Tobin; editing by William James and Sharon Singleton)\nThank you for your report!\nCopyright © 1995-\n            \n\n Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

            "full_content": "Před více než 14 lety vyzvala Anat Ruth Admati, profesorka ekonomie a financí na Stanford University, otevřeným dopisem vedení největší americké banky JPMorgan Chase. Chtěla přimět, aby zejména generální ředitel banky Jamie Dimon přestal házet pod nohy potřebné regulaci, která by majitele bank přiměla navýšit jejich kapitál z vlastních kapes. Podle ní banky navzdory krizi v roce 2008 dál zneužívají finanční nástroje, aby se zbavovaly zodpovědnosti za svá byznysová rozhodnutí.\nSvé závěry z otevřeného dopisu pak profesorka Admati rozvedla v knize Bankéřovi nové šaty s podtitulem Co je v bankovnictví zle a co s tím dělat. V anglickém originále The Bankers’ New Clothes loni vyšla reedice knihy doplněná o dalších 200 stran. Anat Admati a spoluautor knihy, německý ekonom Martin Hellwig z Institutu Maxe Plancka, pokračují ve veřejných prezentacích „Bankéřových nových šatů“, poskytují rozhovory a snaží se upozornit na stále platné závěry svého výzkumu i v podmínkách, které se od finanční krize let 2008- 2009 výrazně změnily.\nO tom, ale také o situaci v USA po prezidentských volbách, hovořila Anat Admati v podcastu PFI Talks. Ten přináší deník e15 spolu s Prague Finance Institute, který spolupracuje s univerzitním ekonomickým výzkumným pracovištěm CERGE-EI. Audio verze rozhovoru je dostupná na běžných podcastových platformách a jako video zde či na YouTube kanálu PFI.\nČasopis Time v roce 2014 zařadil Anat Admati mezi 100 nejvlivnějších lidí na světě a časopis Foreign Policy pak mezi 100 největších globálních myslitelů. Na spoustu ocenění a zařazení do prestižních žebříčků reaguje po svém. „Do reálného vlivu a moci se to ale nepromítá. Kdybych měla moc, regulovala bych třeba banky mnohem lépe,“ říká.\nAnat Ruth Admati je profesorkou financí a ekonomie na Stanford Graduate School of Business a vedoucí pracovnice Stanfordského institutu pro výzkum hospodářské politiky. Pochází z Izraele, vystudovala matematiku na Hebrejské univerzitě v Jeruzalémě a titul PhD. v oboru managementu získala na Yale University. Od roku 2010 se účastní debat po celém světě týkajících se finančních regulací a corporate governance. Její články publikují světová média včetně New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Financial Times.\n„Chci zdravé banky a pokud se velké banky zmenší, bylo by to dobré. Jsou to spíš velké hedgeové fondy s vklady. Vytvářejí mylný dojem, že s penězi z vkladů poskytují půjčky. JPMorgan Chase má 2,5 bilionu dolarů ve vkladech a to, co označuje za půjčky, je jen kolem jednoho bilionu dolarů, což je méně než polovina objemu vkladů. Celková bilance jsou 4 biliony, takže nepůjčují ani čtvrtinu celkových aktiv. Zbytek tvoří obchodování s finančními a dalšími cennými papíry. To přece nemusí dělat s penězi vkladatelů,“ nebere si servítky.\nPodle Admati se od doby krize centrální banky staly klíčovým hráčem ve finančním systému a často zasahují tak, že podporují neefektivní a rizikové chování bank. Házením záchranných lan finančním institucím je vlastně nabádají k tomu, že nemusejí nést odpovědnost. Banky v dnešní podobě, pro které platí okřídlené „too big to fail“ jsou podle ní naprostým zvrácením zásadní kapitalistické myšlenky. A přidává ještě vtipnou anglickou variaci „too big to jail“.\nŽádný bankéř se však podpory a dotací nikdy nevzdá. „Jediný způsob, jak přimět bankovnictví, aby fungovalo, je zavázat celý sektor k tomu, aby byl zdravější. A toho dosáhnete pouze prostřednictvím smysluplné regulace,“ říká americká ekonomka. Bankéři ovšem dobře pracují s narativy a dokázali společnost i politiky přesvědčit, že regulace jsou už tak příliš velké a dusí je. Ve skutečnosti si jen chrání systém podpor, dotací a úlev. I proto použila Admati v knize vlastní narativ odkazující na pohádku Císařovy nové šaty.\nJedním z hlavních problémů podle ní zůstává kapitálová přiměřenost. V rozhovoru přiznává, že banky z 19. století byly férovější, protože jejich majitelé šli s kůží na trh skrze větší kapitálovou expozici. Nemusíme ale chodit tak daleko do minulosti. Dříve měly banky běžně 25 % vlastního kapitálu, dnes mají podstatně méně, což zvyšuje riziko. Navrhuje proto posílit kapitálové rezervy bank, aby zvládly absorbovat ztráty bez potřeby státní pomoci a nepřenášely je na daňové poplatníky. Banky však tvrdí, že to není možné – protože to ohrožuje jejich model závislý na levných penězích a dotacích. Admati varuje před tím, že banky využívají složité finanční nástroje a účetní triky k zakrývání skutečné situace.\nPrague Finance Institute | PFI\nAmerická telekomunikační síť FirstNet podrží stát v případě nouze.

Dokonce insolventní banka může v dnešním systému přežívat jako zombie dlouhou dobu a vegetovat dál z půjčených peněz,“ říká profesorka ekonomie.\nSama přitom přiznává, že změnit se podařilo jen málo a bez reforem bankovní systém bude dál fungovat na principu „privatizace zisků, socializace ztrát“.

Elon Musk a Donald Trump jsou ztělesněním konfliktu zájmů v mnoha oblastech.
